Return to venues:
The challenges of life after Covid

To be sure, the Covid pandemic has not completely disappeared, and may be with us in some form for
some time. But as the number of active cases continues to decrease, for large public venues the top
operational concern has shifted from dealing with
Covid to figuring out how to run events once again at
full capacity, with a host of changes brought about
by the pandemic’s aftermath.

KEY  TAKEAWAYS

The good news is that for our second annual
Stadium Connectivity Outlook survey, an
overwhelming majority of respondents now feel
comfortable placing Covid at or near the bottom
of their concerns. Instead, what venues told us this
year is that challenges of bringing venues back
to full capacity — like finding enough staff to run
the buildings, and how to increase revenue while
operating under the reduced budgets that the Covid
shutdowns precipitated — are now front of mind.

Once again, in August and September of this
year we reached out to the Stadium Tech Report
community and asked them to participate in our
second annual Stadium Connectivity Outlook survey,
which included a wide range of questions about the
current state of a venue’s connectivity, and where

as the sporting and live entertainment
world moved back to full arenas. We also
asked very specific questions about some
of the new technologies that started
emerging last year, like walk-through
security screening systems and cashierless
concessions technology, and found out
that the trend of adopting both was well-
established and accelerating.

Results & Analysis

To be clear, these our not our views but the insights of our audience. Honest feedback that once again
provides an industry-wide perspective on the common issues facing venues of all shapes and sizes,
from large NFL and college football stadiums to MLB stadiums, to NBA and NHL arenas, as well as more
intimate concert halls.

Perhaps due to the acceleration of technology deployments that Covid forced upon the stadium world
— such as a more-rapid than planned
adoption of digital ticketing across the board
to promote better social distancing — one
interesting change from last year to this
year was that more respondents think they
have improved their overall execution of a
digital migration strategy, with more placing
themselves “ahead of” other venues of similar
sizes. But another interesting shift came in
the area of security, where more venues this
year than last said they felt like their overall security stance wasn’t as good as it should be — perhaps, again,
a result of having to take a harder look at all operations and to assess how a more digital future meant a
corresponding need to step up security on all fronts.

“Connectivity is the foundation for
delivering consistent QoE for venue
guests. Quite simply, having better
data and voice capabilities in a venue
improves the guest experience.”

Kevan Akers, SME Connected Venues, Verizon

And the move to more technology also seemed to solidify the respondents’ belief that bringing more
and better wireless connectivity to their venues is still a top priority, with fan-facing services at top of
mind, and with new technologies like network slicing and private cellular networks getting attention
for back-of-house operations, especially those with greater security and throughput concerns.

Wireless, security and new hardware head up the list of planned IT infrastructure
investments.

Challenges: Staffing, not Covid, at top of concerns

After a year when a large majority of respondents cited Covid issues as their top concern, in 2022 that
category dropped all the way to the bottom.

Survey Question: What are the biggest challenges you face in the next 12 months?

At the top of this year’s concern list the runaway winner was staffing, with 61 percent of respondents
citing it as their main worry. A close second was increasing revenue, an area where venues have
adopted technology to help provide more game-day income. Budgetary constraints and lowering
operating costs followed right behind, showing that as venues are coming back to full capacity, the
revenue shortfalls of the Covid shutdowns are still making their presence felt.

What’s on the roadmaps: More wireless, cashierless concessions and
walk-through security

When we asked respondents which initiatives were on their roadmaps for 2023, the top two replies
were improving wireless connectivity for fans (64 percent) and improving connectivity for operations
(58 percent). So even though most venues already have some kind of wireless connectivity throughout
their footprint, it’s clear that the additional demands brought on by Covid-related changes and perhaps
thoughts about what might be needed in the future are keeping wireless infrastructure top of mind.

Survey Question: Which initiatives are on your roadmap for 2023?

Two very specific types of venue technology appeared next on the roadmap list, with walk-through
security screening third (47 percent) followed by cashierless concessions technology (45 percent).

Indeed, some more granular questioning in the survey showed that 37 percent of respondents said they had
experienced a “significant issue with delays or backups due to ticketing and/or security screening,” perhaps
showing that such incidents were not being taken lightly. In fact, 47 percent of respondents said they already
had walk-through security screening systems in place, a fact that corresponds with great interest in the topic we
have seen through our reporting and personal contacts with venue operators over the past year.

Does your venue have walk-through
security screening?

Does your venue have concession stands
with cashierless checkout technology?

The deployment of cashierless concessions technology is also a confirmed trend already happening, with 49
percent of our respondents saying they already had some of the technology in their venues. Again, recent
news reports of multiple such deployments is a sign that this trend has already taken off and will likely
grow quickly over the next year as more venues see the obvious benefits of autonomous checkout–faster
transactions, lower abandonment rates and improved fan experience.

New ideas for private 5G: Back of house, and possibly gaming

Even as venues look to add more traditional wireless capacity for fan-facing networks, the new technology
category of “private 5G” networks is getting attention from this year’s survey respondents as a strategic
method to bring more inherently secure and mobile connectivity to areas with higher security and lower
latency needs.

When we asked what types of workflows venues might use private 5G services for, the top answer was
“back of house/corporate operations.” Since private 5G allows for building owners to set up completely
private networks (that still use off-the-shelf device technology), it’s no surprise that venues are looking
to use private 5G for services like building operations and overall back-office functions, keeping such
channels secure from public networks while also improving the reach and performance of internal
network systems.

Survey Question: With private 5G, you can isolate a portion of the bandwidth
and dedicate it to a specific workflow. Which workflows would you use it for?

The next most important use of private 5G was “in-venue commerce platforms,” which according to
our reporting and research includes concessions, parking and merchandise payments and operations,
as well as payment processing systems. Given the inherently more secure out-of-the-box character
of private 5G systems, using them for anything transaction-related makes sense. Similarly, the third
answer, “Security /surveillance / crowd management communications,” again shows interest in using
private 5G for in-venue communications that require high degrees of reliability and protection.

Venues this year: More advanced on digital transformation, more concerned about
overall security

In order to get a sense of how the venue community was changing from year to year, we kept two
questions exactly the same from last year’s survey to this year’s survey, questions about overall security
posture and digital transformation execution.

2022: In terms of digital transformation execution I am:

2021: In terms of digital transformation execution I am:

The first comparison question from last year to this year showed that more respondents think they
have improved their overall execution of a digital migration strategy, with more placing themselves
“ahead of” other venues of similar sizes. Last year, only 29 percent of respondents thought they were
“slightly ahead” of other similar venues, while 32 percent felt they were at the same point as others,
and 17 percent thought they were slightly behind. This year, the same question saw 41 percent feel like
they were slightly ahead of other similar venues, with 16 percent saying they were about the same and
almost 22 percent saying they felt a little bit behind. Interestingly, those who felt they were “far behind”
stayed almost the same as last year, 8 percent of respondents.

Another interesting shift came in the area of security, where more venues this year than last said they
felt like their overall security stance wasn’t as good as it should be. Last year, 75 percent of respondents
said they felt their security posture and
strategy was “adequate,” but that number
dropped to 66 percent in this year’s
survey. The shift seemed to happen in the
category of “not good enough,” with 20
percent this year versus 10 percent from
the previous survey.

“As connected digital technologies
evolve, new threats are emerging that
endanger the intellectual property
and business operations of teams
and venues. To protect themselves,
these organizations must make
cybersecurity a priority.”

To us, the shift seems like a result of
venues having to take a harder look at
all operations and to assess how a more
digital future meant a corresponding need
to step up security on all fronts. Combined
with the high priority given to plans to beef
up security from an earlier question in the survey, it’s fairly clear that venues of all sizes are recalibrating
their security stances and making the appropriate strategic and tactical plans to improve.

Overall conclusions: Technology has helped venues get past Covid challenges, and
will inform a revamped road map for the new reality

As fans return to venues in significant numbers, it’s clear that an emphasis on technology deployments
has helped venues get past the initial Covid challenges. What is also apparent from our respondents’
insights is that the “new reality” requires a revamped road map, one that has changed rapidly in the
past few years.

The good news for venue connectivity teams and stadium technology professionals is that experienced
partners and proven new technologies are available, and ready to help immediately. Early positive
reviews of walk-through security screening and the rapid adoption of cashierless concessions are both
good signs that venue operators and fans alike are able to quickly embrace new technologies if they
reduce friction, streamline the in-person experience and deliver tangible ROI.
