The new normal: Venues deploy more technology to
meet business and operational goals

As large public venues seek to put their businesses onto a more predictable path following the turmoil
of the Covid pandemic, new technologies are improving the fan experience while simultaneously
driving operational efficiencies and increasing the
bottom line.

Once again, in August and September of this
year we reached out to the Stadium Tech Report
community and asked them to participate in our
third annual Stadium Connectivity Outlook survey,
which included a wide range of questions about the
current state of a venue’s connectivity, and where
the venues, teams and schools plan to prioritize
investments and strategies.

We also asked very specific questions about some of
the new technologies that started emerging in 2022,
like walk-through security screening systems and
cashierless concessions technology, and learned that
the trend of adopting both was not just underway
but had moved to front-of-mind status.

To be clear, these are not our views but the insights
of our audience - honest feedback that once again
provides an industry-wide perspective on the
common issues facing venues of all shapes and

top initiative for the next 12 months, making it a tactical element in a broader strategy to increase revenues
and decrease costs.. Because the new types of cashierless stands often reduce the need for personnel
to operate them, it’s possible that the already rapid deployment of this technology in stadiums was
responsible for reducing anxiety about staffing, which dropped from being last year’s top concern to fourth
on this year’s list.

Survey question: Which initiatives are on your roadmap for 2024? (Check all that apply)

It is not a huge surprise that cashierless concessions, a topic that has dominated the news and
analysis coverage for the past year at Stadium Tech Report, has moved to the top of the list of venues’
deployment roadmaps for 2024. A full 65 percent of our respondents included cashierless concessions
on their list of initiatives for the next 12 months. Next up on that same list was improved in-venue
connectivity for fans (59 percent) and improved connectivity for operations (54 percent).

According to research we published
in October 2023, almost 100 new
checkout-free concession stands
had been deployed in stadiums over
the past year, alongside numerous
deployments of other frictionless
retail solutions, including optical
scanning checkout terminals, self-
checkout kiosks with bar-code
readers, and even systems using facial
authentication for purchase and age verification.

“New technologies supported by a unified
network architecture are proving to be
a cost-effective way to improve venue
operations. Venues need to ensure their
infrastructures are robust enough to
support continued innovation.”

Scott Lawrence, SVP of Global Solutions, Verizon

Missing key moments in a game or performance while waiting to grab a snack or purchase
merchandise negatively impacts the live event experience. Our in-person reporting on cashierless
concession technology has shown a high rate of fan acceptance and use, since many of the venues
using these innovative solutions are able to reduce average transaction times to less than a minute.

Autonomous checkout is an attractive solution. Many teams and venues have reported that they’ve
been able to grow revenue by increasing transaction volume and basket size, while also improving the

fan experience by significantly reducing queuing time. Further, when replacing traditional belly-up
stands with new frictionless solutions, they’ve gained operational efficiencies by having the ability to
allocate their staff more effectively, which is perhaps one of the reasons why staffing was less a concern
in this year’s survey compared to 2022.

With 66 percent of respondents this year saying they already have cashierless concession stands in their
venues, and 65 percent of respondents saying cashierless concessions are on their roadmap for 2024
(compared to 45 percent a year ago) we expect to see even more adoption over the next 12 months.

We also expect to see more venues adopt walk-through security screening technology in the coming
year, with 46 percent of venues putting that topic on their 2024 roadmap.

Sandwiched in between those two topics was a desire to improve in-venue connectivity for fans (59 percent
of respondents) and in-venue connectivity for operations (54 percent). The first number clearly reflects
concerns about the explosion of big data usage at jewel events. The second addresses the importance of
having secure, reliable bandwidth for back-of-house ops including ticketing and point-of-sale.

Venues focus on budget challenges

Survey question: What are the biggest challenges you face in the next 12 months? (Check all that apply)

The increased interest in deploying new technologies that can directly improve revenues and lower
operational costs is likely the main way venues are seeking to address their top concerns, which for this
year’s survey focused completely on fiscal issues.

In order, the top answers from this year’s respondents are lowering operating costs (56 percent
of respondents), increasing revenues (55 percent) and working within the confines of budgetary
constraints (53 percent). Staffing, last year’s top concern (60 percent of respondents in 2022), dropped
to fourth on the list with 45 percent.

Interest grows for multiple uses of private 5G

Survey question: With private 5G, you can isolate a portion of the bandwidth and dedicate
it to a specific workflow. Which workflows would you use it for? (Check all that apply)

On other communications tech fronts, venues said they are looking for more ways to use private 5G
networks internally. Verizon’s deployment of coach-to-coach on-field networks in every NFL stadium is
just one reason why respondents may have shown an increase in interest from last year for applications
like on-field operations.

By keeping most of our survey questions the same as last year, we were able to come up with some
interesting comparisons across the entire survey. One of the more interesting ones came in our
question about how venues might utilize private 5G.

While using private 5G for back-of-house operations was still the top selection, even that category grew
in interest, from 51 percent of respondents in 2022 to 56 percent in 2023. Using private 5G for security
and surveillance communications moved up a notch from the third-most mentioned choice to second
this year, with percentages growing from 41 percent of respondents to 48 percent.

The categories for on-field operations and player-performance analytics both increased by 13 percent
each among respondents, with those numbers now at 45 percent for on-field operations and 33
percent for player-performance anayltics. By delivering greater stability, speed and security, dedicated
private 5G networks are a viable option for venues looking to solve bandwidth issues in areas with
higher security and lower latency requirements.

With respondents being able to check “all that apply” to the question about private 5G, the interesting
factor was that almost every category showed more interest than in 2022. Even one new category we
added for this year, Microbetting (in-app or at sportsbook), was selected by 13 percent of respondents.

Wireless demand continues to grow

Survey question: Which areas will you be making changes in your IT infrastructure to support
growth or reduce operating costs over the next 12-18 months: (Check all that apply)

With mega-events like the Super Bowl and the recent Taylor Swift concert tour continuing to
break single-day stadium wireless consumption records, it’s no surprise that improving wireless
communications remains a top concern for venues across the board.

“The ‘Taylor Swift’ effect is very
real. With bandwidth needs
continuing to increase, venues
need to make sure their network
infrastructure keeps pace with
demand.”

Mike Ruhnke, VP Enterprise Sales, Verizon

The good news is, even as demand
continues to increase, new technology and
new spectrum chunks for services like 5G
celluar networks and Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E
deployments are showing the ability to
provide much faster communication and
wider channels of bandwidth than previous
deployments.

Now if Taylor Swift decides to attend a
Super Bowl as a fan, all bets on having

enough bandwidth may be off. But at least venues are showing their intentions to invest in wireless well
before any such data-consumption armageddon.

2023

2022

Moving into the top spot on the IT infrastructure spending was network/web security, which posted a slight
gain from the previous year’s survey, increasing from 56 percent of respondents to 60 percent this year. The
increased attention to security might be the reason why more respondents also feel more confident this
year about thie existing security posture and strategy. On that question, respondents who felt their position
was “not good enough” dropped from 20 percent in 2022 to 15 percent in 2023, while those who felt their
security was “ironclad” rose from 7 percent a year ago to 9 percent in this year’s survey. At the other end,
however, some more concern may be necessary as the number of venues who responded “I don’t know”
what their existing security posture is grew from 7 percent in 2022 to 10 percent in 2023.

Overall conclusions: The drive toward more technology use in venues means that
faster, more secure connectivity continues to be a priority

As technology is deployed to solve more of the pain points of both attending events as well as running
in-stadium businesses, the need for faster, more secure methods of connectivity remains at a premium.
Our respondents’ replies show both a willingness to try new things to solve old problems, especially
in areas like concessions and security, which had been without major changes for many years, as
well as the sensibility to know that expanding technology usage comes with a parallel need for the
infrastructure to support it.

The responses to our survey questions show venues know about the needs to control costs and to find
new ways to raise revenues, as well as the knowledge to keep investing in good, reliable, protected
network infrastructure, the lifeblood of many of the other functions that are becoming the “new
normal” in stadium operations. The good news is, advanced new technologies paired with expanded
wireless spectrum resources are giving experienced partners even more ways to help venues find the
best path along their digital transformation journey.
