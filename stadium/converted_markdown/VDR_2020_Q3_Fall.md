Once just a vision captured by artist renderings, the main video
board at SoFi Stadium is now a stunning reality, showing what’s
possible when you combine a powerful idea with the technology,
construction expertise and the will to make it so.

W hile fans will have to wait for the

pandemic to subside before they
can  enjoy  its  attributes,  like  its
full 4K resolution, the 120-yards
long  double-sided  oval  video-
board from Samsung – which is
as tall as four stories high at its largest points – was pro-
viding “wow” moments to stadium staff and some NFL
players who got to witness the first live projections on
the circular system in late August, and then again at the
Los Angeles Rams’ NFL season opener on Sept. 13.

“It’s absolutely fascinating – I’ve never seen anything
like it,” said Skarpi Hedinsson, chief technology officer
for  SoFi  Stadium  and  Hollywood  Park.  The  stadium  is
home to two NFL teams, the Los Angeles Rams and the
Los Angeles Chargers. During the Rams scrimmage, the
board was lit up and Hedinsson walked all around the

stadium for looks from as many vantage points as possi-
ble, and came away stunned.

“It’s everything we had hoped for,” Hedinsson said.

“It’s exactly what it was designed to do.”

Vision of Kroenke
  When  the  idea  of  what  would  become  SoFi  Stadi-
um was being developed, several sources we talked to
pointed to Rams Owner/Chairman and SoFi Stadium and
Hollywood Park developer Stan Kroenke as the vision-
ary for a videoboard that had never been done before.

“I  have  to  give  full  credit  to  Mr.  Kroenke  for  the
vision,”  said  Hedinsson.  “He  sat  down  with  HKS,  our
architects, and asked what was the ‘art of the possible.’  It
was all part of how to innovate for the guest experience,
and how to approach it.”

The evolution of videoboards in large NFL-type ven-
ues has become an interesting trend to watch, with high-
lights  along  the  way  including  the  massive  centerhung
screen at the Dallas Cowboys’ home, AT&T Stadium, and
the circular “Halo Board” that sits below the outside edg-
es of the camera shutter-like closable roof at the Atlanta
Falcons’ Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

A t SoFi Stadium (and the adjacent Hol-

lywood Park), where various reports
estimate  that  Kroenke  has  spent
somewhere  north  of  $5  billion  in
development costs, the needle of in-
novation  has  now  been  moved  in  a
much different direction. Originally nicknamed the “Oc-
ulus” (a term no longer used by the stadium) the dou-
ble-sided oval board hangs from the stadium’s cable-sup-
ported  roof  in  a  manner  designed  to  present  a  clear
video view to any seat in the house, from the field-level
seats all the way up to the highest decks. Capacity for
SoFi  Stadium  is  estimated  at  approximately  70,000  for
NFL  games,  and  up  to  100,000  for  special  events,  like
the Super Bowl.

So what are the stats?

According to figures provided by SoFi Stadium and
by Samsung, the videoboard sits 122 feet above the play-
ing field and 70 feet below the roof canopy; at 120 yards
it is longer than the field of play, and it is also wider than
the field. According to Samsung, its outdoor LED prod-
ucts  were  used  exclusively  to  build  the  70,000  square-

6        VENUE DISPLAY REPORT FALL 2020

foot dual-sided screen, which contains nearly 80 million
pixels at a spacing distance of 8 millimeters from center
to center.

The board is not symmetrical in shape for a reason:
According to Samsung, the different sizes are part of the
strategy of making the board visible to all seats in the
venue. Mark Quiroz, Samsung’s vice president for sales,
marketing and business development, said the company
did virtual simulations of the screen’s visibility angles to
all the seating sections to help determine the best final
shape.

“It was all about getting the best views for the fans,”

Quiroz said of the virtual testing.

At its tallest points, the board’s largest panel is ap-
proximately  40  feet  tall;  at  the  smallest  points  it  is  ap-
proximately  20  feet  tall.  According  to  Samsung,    fans
seated in the lower bowl will view the inside of the vid-
eoboard, while fans in the upper bowl areas will view
the outer panels of the videoboard.

According to SoFi Stadium, the videoboard not only
features the most LEDs ever used in a sports or enter-
tainment venue, but it also has the first 4K end-to-end
video  production  in  a  stadium,  one  that  has  12  Gbps
connections between cameras to ensure enough band-
width for the higher-resolution content. The videoboard
also has a JBL audio system that is home to more than
260 of the stadium’s approximately 4,500 loudspeakers.

According to Hedinsson, the videoboard will also even-
tually house 5G cellular antennas, since the location of
the board gives it a perfect line-of-sight mounting posi-
tion for the seating bowl.

If Hedinsson’s initial impression is correct, it would
seem that all the partners involved in the board’s con-
struction  and  deployment  nailed  Kroenke’s  original  vi-
sion,  and  made  it  come  to  life.  But  it  was  far  from  an
easy task.

How to build ‘the art of the possible’

According to Hedinsson, the uniqueness of the vid-
eoboard  and  its  structural  size  dictated  that  all  design
had to start by thinking about the board first.

“It [the videoboard] needed to be part of the earliest
discussions  –  you  have  to  design  around  an  idea  like
that,’ Hedinsson said. Since the 2.2-million-pound board
would rely on the stadium’s cable-net roof for support, it
was both one of the first structures to be designed, and
one of the last to be put in place. The board was actual-
ly assembled on the ground inside the venue, and then
hoisted into place after the roof was built.”

According to Samsung’s Quiroz, the final installation
of  the  board  involved  a  lot  more  than  just  pulling  on
some cables.

“The  most  challenging  aspect  [of  the  construction]
was  the  tolerance  levels  in  the  seams,”  said  Quiroz,
talking about the tightness needed to keep screens close
together so that the video output does not have any vis-
ible breaks.

“Getting the seams right on the ground was one thing,
and then keeping it together until you get it in the final
resting place was another major challenge,” Quiroz said.

As if the construction team needed any more diffi-
culty, during the final months of building the project had
to deal with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. While
admitting that Covid was “kind of a cloud that loomed
over everything,” Quiroz said that since the overall proj-
ect was a closed situation in a fairly large space made
it somewhat easier to deal with safety requirements like
social distancing.

Using the new canvas
  When fans finally are allowed in the venue, the final
chapter of the SoFi Stadium videoboard will be written
– or, more accurately, shown in 4K resolution, as game
information and sponsor messages make use of the one-
of-a-kind  screenscape.  With  the  circular  shape,  all  the
potential  providers  of  content  –  from  the  teams  to  the
potential sponsors – seem excited about the possibilities.

“With  the  custom  shape,  there  are  probably  things
that still need to be developed,” said Samsung’s Quiroz,

inside and outside screens.

about the need for new design tools and new ways of
thinking about what types of content might be possible.
“We provided the template, so now it’s all about how you
can use the capacity.”

A ccording  to  Hedinsson,  the  SoFi

tenant  teams  –  both  the  Rams  and
the  Chargers  –  have  actively  been
working on building content for the
board since December of 2019. With
various “modes” available for display
– including full 360-degree perspectives and “full take-
over,”  where  the  Ross  Video  and  Cisco  Vision  display
management systems in tandem will allow a single mes-
sage  across  not  just  the  video  board  but  over  all  the
2,000-plus smaller displays in the venue – Hedinsson is
looking forward to times when the video board fulfills
its promise of being able to “amplify the atmosphere”.

“The teams have really embraced [the board’s possi-
bilities],” Hedinsson said. “We’re going to see some really
interesting uses of the space.” VDR
