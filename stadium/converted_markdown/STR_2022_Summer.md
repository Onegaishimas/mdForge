WELCOME TO THE NEW
STADIUM TECH REPORT,
BETTER THAN THE OLD
STADIUM TECH REPORT!

Networked restrooms? Podcasts? Concession

technology? If you are a longtime Stadium Tech Report

reader, you might be wondering what’s going on here.

But to readers old and new we simply say welcome --

welcome to our new coverage strategy, which is really

hitting its stride with this current issue of the Stadium

Tech Report.

Once again, as we’ve done now
for the past nine years, we’ve got
a quarterly issue full of long, in-
depth stories that provide stadium
technology professionals with the
deep dives they need to inform
themselves to help their stadiums
and arenas keep up with the
times. And while we haven’t given

up on our past roots of focusing
on wireless networking, as this
issue shows we’ve significantly
added areas of expertise to our
coverage, including, yes, networked
restrooms.

Laugh a bit you might, but the
very obvious benefits of bringing
networked connectivity to stadium

restrooms are outlined in our topic-
opening profile by our reporter
Terry Sweeney. Like with the other
subjects we now cover closely --
including concessions technology
and entry/security technology -- we
plan to keep close tabs on stadium
restroom IoT trends going forward,
simply because it looks like the
kind of thing that -- like Wi-Fi -- will
be taken for granted as we all move
forward.

ADDING PODCASTS TO THE MIX

While we still think our quarterly
long-form reports offer a depth
of information that you just can’t
find anywhere else, we are also
moving ahead with alternate forms
of content delivery, including
our new Stadium Tech Report
podcast series. While we had some
podcasts in the past (you can still
listen to them all) until recently we
never really had the production
resources necessary to support a
sustained podcasting effort.

THAT WAS THEN, THIS IS NOW.

With the recent release of our
fourth episode our new series is off
to a resounding start, with many
new listeners lending us an ear.
The production skills of our design
team -- led by creative director Dan
Grimsley and digital designer Jackie
Nguyen -- have made our podcasts
much easier and better to listen to.
We also thank our podcast sponsors,

To better serve our busy audience
we have radically shortened our
survey for this year, and streamlined
it so it can easily be taken on a
phone -- our trial timing shows
it takes less than 3 minutes to
complete. For that small effort
your answers can help your peers
immensely, as while we are happy
to write stories about technology
deployments there is nothing as
good as cumulative data to help
provide a snapshot of what venues
are doing and why.

And just like our email newsletter,
you can be confident that no data
from your answers will be identified
with your person, team or venue. So
join us in our more-content effort
with your survey answers, and stay
tuned for even more good stuff as
we go forward!

STADIUM

ExteNet Systems and MatSing,
for helping provide the resources
necessary for our expanded list of
interviews.

Stay tuned, we’ve already got some
more good episodes in the can
and more scheduled down the line.
Available wherever fine podcasts
are found -- Apple iTunes, Google
Podcasts, Spotify -- you can now
bring STR expertise with you to
the gym, in the car, in the plane, or
wherever else you can simply listen
in.

HOW TO STAY IN TOUCH --
SUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER!

With more new readers and
listeners discovering Stadium
Tech Report on a daily basis --
some via our new content-sharing
relationships with the Association
of Luxury Suite Directors (ALSD)
and the International Association
of Venue Managers -- as well as
through the continued growth
of social-media sharing of STR
content via LinkedIn and Twitter -- it
may be helpful to know the best way
to stay on top of all the new content
we are providing: Simply subscribe
to our email newsletter.

While you can certainly bookmark
the STR home page, or subscribe to
our podcast feed, veteran members
of the STR audience know that our
email newsletter is a simple way to
make sure you don’t miss anything,
since everything we write or record

always gets at least one link from
our email feed.

What else do veteran audience
members know about our email
list? Two important things: One,
we NEVER share or sell our email
address list. Not to anyone, not
to “partners,” not ever. Two, we
don’t blast readers with incessant
daily emails in desperate searches
for clicks, because that’s not our
business model. We pretty much
send emails only when there is
something new on the site or in our
podcast series. Why? It’s because
we know our readers are always
busy, and don’t have time every day
to sift through repeated messages
looking for the something new.
When you get an email for us,
there’s usually something you
haven’t seen before in it.

GIVE BACK TO YOUR PEERS -- TAKE
OUR SURVEY!

With all the new content, the
podcasts, the new topics, you may
ask -- what do we charge for all
this goodness? The quick answer
is, as it has always been -- nothing,
other than your attention. If there
is one thing we do ask for, it’s to
encourage our audience members
who are directly employed by
stadiums, teams or venues to take
our annual Stadium Connectivity
Survey, which will be live in early
August.

Sitting snugly behind the historic

Belmont Park racetrack in Elmont,
N.Y., in Nassau County but just to

the east of the border of Queens, the new
$1.5 billion project built by the Islanders,
Oak View Group and Sterling Equities
looks modest from the outside, with its
blocky red-brick facade.

Inside the doors the building reveals itself
to be a gem, with wide-open architectural
features that suggest an old-style
railroad station, with classic designs. But
the building is also definitely a venue for
the future, filled with top-level wireless
connectivity, leading-edge concessions
technology and other features all
designed to use technology as much as
possible to improve the fan experience.
Wide concourses and club spaces
and higher-end architectural finishes
complete the comfortable feeling of a
“new home” that Islanders fans and Long
Island eventgoers can feel proud of.

Stadium Tech Report got to visit UBS Arena in early
July, during the ALSD trade show and conference in
New York City. Our “tech tour” of UBS Arena spotlighted
some of the innovations deployed throughtout the
venue by OVG, the Islanders and technology partners
Verizon, Cisco, JMA, Amazon, Clover, Triple Play, and
Daktronics.

Though our tour was taken in an empty venue, we were
still able to witness and test some impressive baseline
wireless connectivity speeds, view the video assets
throughout the building and get a live view of one of the
newest things to hit the stadium concessions space,
Amazon’s Just Walk Out technology. Short of seeing
them perform in front of a full house, it’s easy to see
that the sum of the parts of UBS Arena could add up to
a first-class fan experience.

“We have a very damaged fan
base, one that came from an
arena that was definitely not
the stadium of the future,”
said Ethan Brown, senior
vice president, marketing and
community relations for UBS
Arena.

“But last year when our season ticket holders walked in
for the first time, some of them were crying. They could
not believe this was all for them.”

arena’s main entry. Once inside, the soaring rooftop
space of the “Great Hall” (with its star-like ceiling
lighting) and the stunning clarity of a large three-sided
videobard immediately tell you that this is not just a
stadium but a gathering place with style, with the feel
of a Grand Central Station from years before.

And function follows the form, as the wide, open entry
area looks like it allows for easy flow of fans, with
multiple staircase, escalator and other pathways to the
different seating sections inside.

“When you walk in [to the Great Hall], you get an
immediate sense of the
majesty,” Brown said. “It’s
also relatively seamless to
get fans going in the right
direction.”

If there is one thing
necessary to make the
fan experience seamless
in venues these days,
it’s high-quality wireless
connectivity. With so much
of today’s in-game activity
reliant on connectivity,
both for fans and back of house operations, it’s perhaps
no surprise that the wireless networks at UBS Arena
are at the top levels for a venue its size (17,255 capacity
for hockey, approximately 19,000 for concerts). Both
the Wi-Fi network and the in-house cellular networks
were deployed by Verizon, using Cisco gear for Wi-Fi
and JMA Wireless equipment for cellular.

For the main seating bowl, both Wi-Fi and cellular DAS
antennas are mounted mostly under seat; according
to UBS Arena IT staff, the Wi-Fi network has “almost”
1,000 APs installed throughout the building. And again
while we were there in a mostly empty building, we did
get Wi-Fi speedtests of 169 Mbps on the download and
182 Mbps on the upload in a lounge space, and a 160
Mbps / 188 mark in one of the premium club spaces just
off the main concourse level. A cellular-only speedtest
on our Verizon phone in the same area hit 97.9 Mbps /
54.0 Mbps.

According to the UBS Arena
IT staff leading our tour, the
venue recently installed 12
Cisco Catalyst 9104 Stadium
Antennas, also known as the
“Marlin” antenna by Wi-Fi
insiders, in its overhead
ceiling structure. According
to the IT staff at UBS Arena
the 9104s, which were
designed to support much
greater distances between
antenna and client, are a
big upgrade for the venue’s

Wi-Fi coverage of the stadium floor for concerts and
other non-hockey events. We also spotted a couple of
MatSing Lens Antennas in the upper infrastructure,
whose similar longer-throw capabilities no doubt assist
in cellular coverage for the hard-to-reach seats near
the playing surface or for floor seats.

and as such Brown said the venue didn’t have a lot of
metrics yet on use. Like other implementations of the
checkout-free stores, he said fans need a little time to
understand the systems -- but after trying it once, most
come back quickly as they learn the game-changing
transaction speed the stores can support.

At other concession stands we saw around the arena,
kiosk-ordering and self-checkout systems from Clover
are in place, another technology rapidly gaining favor
in stadiums. With post-Covid hospitality staffing a
challenge at venues worldwide, many stadiums like
UBS Arena are finding that a bank of self-checkout
systems can not only reduce staffing needs but can
also help speed up the overall purchasing process, a
win-win for venue and fans.

UBS Arena is also leaning in a direction gaining favor
in many stadiums, in offering local-favorite food items
in specialty stands, as well as new national brands like
Shaq’s Big Chicken.

“We’ve really stepped it up on
the food offerings,” Brown
said. “It’s a completely new
experience.”

DIGITAL SIGNAGE PLAYS A BIG ROLE

As befits the overall scheme, the large videoboards
inside UBS Arena from Daktronics are stunning in size
and clarity, with the main centerhung board featuring 5.9
millimeter pixel spacing for extreme clarity. There is also
a very large, three-sided screen just inside the front door
(“We call it the ‘Z-screen,’ “ Brown said) that provides a
flashy entry welcome as guests enter the arena.

All around the venue, digital displays of various
sizes are prevalent, and thanks to the advanced
management system from provider Triple Play, they
can be configured on the fly to provide custom content
tailored not just to the event happening that night, but
also to the particulars of the space they are located in.

“The IPTV screens let us create a separate experience
in specific areas,” Brown said. We also saw more digital

displays outside the arena that assist with wayfinding,
a nice touch since fans may be coming in from different
areas, like parking or mass transit.

There were also a host of smaller technological tweaks
that again, added up inside the overall strategy of
using technology to improve the experience wherever
possible. On the cutting-edge level were devices that
used biometric eye scanning for secure entrance
(like to the locker rooms) and a neat device in the
performers’ “Green Room” spaces where entertainers

FASTER CONCESSIONS VIA WALK-OUT AND
SELF-CHECKOUT TECHNOLOGY

If there is one thing that differentiates hockey fans
(and maybe soccer fans as well) from other sports, it’s
that hockey fans typically don’t want to miss any of
the on-ice action, which has fewer built-in stoppages
than sports like football, basketball and baseball. To
better serve its fans, UBS Arena has put an emphasis
on leading-edge concessions technology that aims to
significantly reduce the amount of time spent in line
purchasing food and beverages.

The most interesting of those is the presence of two “Just
Walk Out” stores powered by technology from Amazon.
Customers at Just Walk Out stores can simply scan a credit
card at the entry gate, enter the store, select the items
they want, and leave, with billing taking place online. Such
“checkout-free” installations, which are also available at
other venues using technology from startups Zippin and
Ai-Fi, are quickly gaining popularity among sports fans for
their ability to facilitate concessions purchases that take
seconds, as opposed to minutes, to complete.

The Amazon stores at UBS Arena, called “On the Fly”
in a nod to the way hockey teams make replacements
by jumping over the boards instead of waiting for a
stoppage in play, came online in April of this year,

tech stack. Credit: Paul Kapustka, STR

and their crews could tap their mobile devices on a
special receptor which would then share with them
the back-of-house Wi-Fi password for the day --
eliminating the need to post passwords on paper.

And though we didn’t have time to visit the team store, its
size and breadth of shopping options are assisted by what
Brown called an automatic bin system that can scan all
the items a customer brings to checkout without a staffer
having to ring up each item separately.

On a more simple level the stadium had numerous
device charging stations, in the concourses as well as
in premium seating areas and even in restroom lounges
-- including a women’s restroom in the suite level that

has now set the bar for size and comfort, as it comes
complete with a lounge with a circular couch and
individual seats with mirrors and charging outlets.

“The idea was to surprise
and delight at as many
touchpoints as we could,”
said Brown, who noted that
the issue of “not enough
bathrooms” at the old
Islanders’ stadium is now
something far in the past.

But some good things from the past -- like the Stanley
Cup champion banners hanging from the ceiling -- and
a seating layout that keeps the roof low so top-level
seats are positioned right above the ice are meant to
make sure the new venue makes the longtime fans feel
like they’re at a place they’d love to call their new home.

“We want the fans to leave here talking about how
wonderful the experience was,” Brown said. “And then
to want to come back again.”

of) traffic lights (and traffic), thermostats and light
switches. IoT momentum has continued as devices and
machines in factories and warehouses get networked
as well. It was only a matter of time before the
restrooms at sporting venues got IoT’d.

In hindsight, though, equipping soap and paper
dispensers, sinks and toilets in restrooms with wireless
sensors was a bit of a no-brainer. Cisco, IBM, Intel and
others have been evangelizing the connected restroom
concept for more than four years. So why have IoT-
connected restrooms caught on recently? Everyone
in the restroom supply chain –  from makers of paper
products, bathroom fixtures and soap vendors, not to
mention wireless networking vendors – all point to the
global pandemic as an awareness-building exercise
around hygiene. Covid has dramatically changed the
conversation where hygiene and human contact are
concerned.

Faucets, toilets and other fixtures have already been
networked in restrooms at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in
Indianapolis, where both the NBA and WNBA teams
play. PPG Paints Arena, home of the NHL’s Pittsburgh
Penguins, has been upgraded with connected
restrooms. Other venues like Denver’s Empower Field
at Mile High; Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas; and
the Chase Center in San Francisco have all followed
suit.

The Texas Rangers reworked their restrooms prior
to the 2021 baseball season at Globe Life Field. The
team installed Georgia-Pacific’s Kolo Smart Monitoring
System, essentially a management console for
connected restrooms that ensures clean restrooms
that are fully stocked with toilet paper, paper towels,
soap and hand sanitizer.

“This is a state-of-the-art facility that was designed
for Rangers fans and event guests to have the best
possible experience from the moment they walk
through the entrance gates until the moment they
leave,” said Mike Healy, senior vice president of venue
operations and guest experience with the Texas
Rangers and Globe Life Field, in a prepared statement.

“Our own data suggests
that how clean and well
maintained our restrooms
are directly and significantly
impacts how fans perceive
the rest of our facility,”
Healy added. “So it was very
important to us to invest in a
restroom solution that clearly
conveys our facility-wide
commitment to cleanliness
and the guest experience.”

CAN NETWORKED RESTROOMS IMPROVE THE
BOTTOM LINE?

So while an improved customer experience and the
money-saving aspects of connected restrooms might
prove compelling, what if such facilities could actually

20    STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   SUMMER 2022

STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   SUMMER 2022     21

restrooms, flush a toilet, or check a faucet line without
sending a person, she added.

Sometimes there’s a stagnant water smell if it hasn’t
been flushed in a while, according to the Sloan product
manager. And no surprise – facilities want to minimize
unpleasant odors for health, hygiene and sensory
reasons. “Water is also a valuable resource and is
drawing far more attention with the droughts,” Badger
said. Many stadiums and arenas also want to be good to
the environment. “They use a whole lot of water every
time a toilet flushes.”

Another driver is that venues are interested in users-
to-handwashing ratios, especially near food facilities.
“They’re looking for stats and data to make sure
employees are washing their hands,” to keep things as
sanitary as possible, she said.

IoT in restrooms also takes preventative maintenance
to a whole new level since venue operators know
when restrooms are busiest and how many times a
toilet or faucet has been used. Connected restrooms
allow them to better predict and perform preventative
maintenance to make sure each facility is operating
properly for customer satisfaction.

HOW THE IOT RESTROOM WORKS

The wireless sensors in connected restrooms draw
on Bluetooth and Long Range Radio (LoRa) for
connectivity. “Bluetooth is typically the short-range
connection, while LoRaWAN is the long distance, low-
power connection,” explained Donna Quinn, CEO and
chairwoman of the LoRa Alliance.

help sporting venues make money? That’s part of the
spin on the IoT sales pitch from Georgia-Pacific. The
paper goods company cited a 2015 J.D. Power and
Associates study that measured satisfaction levels
of users in airports, a useful analog to the transient
crowds at sporting venues.

customer experience. Credit, top left and right, Georgia Pacific.

“They documented that passengers making
connections who had a ‘good experience’ would spend
190 percent more than a dissatisfied one… a crazy
number!” said John Strom, VP and general manager of
connected solutions, GP Pro, at Georgia-Pacific.

Faye Badger, product line manager, IoT, for plumbing
fixture company Sloan observed that each facility has its
own particular focus. Stadiums and arenas are looking for
labor savings; most want to be able to monitor facilities
remotely and change settings as needed.

“With intermittent-use venues like stadiums, during
the sport season, or even for a concert, it may not be
used for a couple weeks,” she explained. That forces
the question of how venue operators can monitor

“People like Bluetooth because it’s very common,” said
Dan Quant, vice president of strategic development
for IoT electronics equipment maker MultiTech. That
familiarity means it’s easier to deploy; Bluetooth is
also well suited to 1:1 interaction and to connecting
with a gateway, but it’s typically not suitable for longer-
distance communications.

Restrooms are generally hostile environments for RF
propagation, according to Sloan’s Badger. “You have
metal stall partitions; the flush valve is metal; you have
a metal faucet, and the controls are often under the
sink – it’s not very friendly to wireless.”

Customer consultations and signal strength
measurements help to ensure that connected
restrooms work the way they were
intended. “Once we do a few rooms, we get
a pretty good idea of a pattern about how it
will work,” Badger added.

Older buildings with lots of rebar and
concrete can be tough environments
for wireless signal propagation, noted
MultiTech’s Quant. “Tinting on office
building windows can also be reflective,
along with marble and reflective
surfaces,” creating deployment and
operational challenges, he added. “From
our perspective, LoRa has been the best
solution for that.”

ADDING RESTROOM CONNECTIVITY
SLOWLY

As with other emerging technologies,

 “Then the discussions turns
to how quickly customers
can get the signal out [to the
network], so Bluetooth-to-
LoRa gateways are becoming
very popular,” Quant added.

From there, the IoT device links can connect to IoT
gateways, then to Wi-Fi and even CBRS and private
LTE networks that are becoming increasingly common
inside venues.

But as stadium and arena managers have discovered,
building materials can be a huge challenge to wireless
installations, depending on what’s in use and the age of
the facility.

stadium and arena operators are likely to use a more
phased approach to restroom IoT deplolyment, said
Mel Raines, president and COO of Pacers Sports and
Entertainment, which owns the Indiana Pacers. The
Pacers’ arena, the Gainbridge Fieldhouse, built in
downtown Indianapolis in 1999, is undergoing a three-
year $360 million renovation, including a network
upgrade and new restrooms.

But when renovations are completed this fall, only
a small subset of the venue’s restrooms will be
IoT-equipped. Raines explained that through its
partnership with Sloan, they decided to create a touch-
free environment for the arena’s CareSource Courtside
Club, a premium space that accommodates about 600
people. In the club, there are five stalls in the women’s
room, and three urinals and two stalls in the men’s
room.

“We have a red-yellow-green indicator outside the
restrooms, so club visitors know how full they are,”
Raines said. “That’s been really great during peak
times like just before tip-off or at halftime – a great
service for customers,” she added. “Each entry door
to the restroom also has a sensor so that the door
automatically opens as someone approaches; visitors
also wash and dry their hands in the same sensor-
equipped sink” in keeping with touchless experience.

“We’re also working on
making the doors to the stalls
touchless,” Raines said. “It’s
pretty slick.”

The door is also open to expanding the connected-
restroom concept to the rest of Gainbridge Fieldhouse,
but Raines and her team want to see how the initial
systems perform and what the customer feedback is.

“We have a reputation for one of the cleanest, most
spotless buildings there are, and we take great pride in
that,” she added.

Expanding connected restrooms across the entire
venue may present unforeseen challenges, Raines
acknowledged. “We were lucky we were renovating
because we could essentially design this into the
renovations – it wasn’t a retrofit,” she said. “It’s been a
great partnership with Sloan and they continue to fine-
tune things. Depending on how it goes, we may deploy
elsewhere.”

\ \  BY PAUL KAPUSTKA

Once a curiosity deployed mainly in trial

situations, the concessions technology
known as “checkout free” or “just walk
out” is ready for its prime-time moment

in stadiums, with a host of new deployments already
announced or coming soon to a venue near you.

Leading suppliers of the technology are currently
busy announcing new stadium stores, with more
announcements expected before the start of the
U.S. football season this fall. Zippin, a San Mateo,
Calif.-based startup, recently announced five new
checkout-free stores at the Tennessee Titans’
Nissan Stadium, bringing its announced total to
30 stadium stores, which leads the marketplace.
Amazon, with a recent announcement of three new
“Just Walk Out” stores coming to Texas A&M’s Kyle
Field, now has 14 announced or open stadium stores.

And AiFi, another startup, announced a new store at
Leicester City’s King Power Stadium, with promises of
more announcements coming soon.

GET IN, GET OUT

If you’re not familiar with checkout-free stores,
these are concession stands where customers enter
stores by scanning a credit card or some other pre-
authorization method at entry gates and then simply
take items off shelves and are charged automatically
as they leave the store. Why is this technology so
powerful? In the short life of networked stadium
technology developments, few innovations have
benefited both fans and venue businesses so quickly
and so directly.

For fans it’s as low impact as you can get -- you enter
billing information in an app, or even easier, just show
up with a valid credit card. You walk in, grab something,
and leave, often within seconds. Especially for fans just

looking to grab something simple, like a cold drink, it’s
easy to see the appeal of the new stores.

For teams, venues and other concessions operators,
the technology is heaven on many levels. For starters,
having everything automated means fewer employees
in lower-value positions. While the format means
that there are additional steps necessary to make the
systems work (there is a non-significant amount of
gear needed, mainly cameras), once that flow is set in
place all you have to worry about is restocking.

And the latest emerging trend for the checkout-free
stores is even more appealing to venues: A “drink
lane” type stand where fans buy only beverages in
a smaller, straight-line store format. According to
one of the technology providers, such “drink lanes”
can turn previously unused real estate (like the
space beneath stairs or escalators) into a revenue-
producing spot that can add as much as $10,000 in
new business during a single event. Being smaller in

size makes the drink lanes also easier and cheaper
to deploy, giving teams, schools and venues a way
to test the waters on the technology without having
to commit to a more-expensive renovation of larger
existing concessions stands.

What follows here is a recap of recent interviews and
reporting on announced and imminent plans from the
top three providers of the technology, and how their
offerings might fit into the concessions plans of teams,
schools, venues and caterers.

ZIPPIN: DATA, DOLLARS AND DESIGN FLEXIBILITY

At the recent ALSD trade show and conference in
New York, Zippin was able to show attendees one of
its premier stores up close and personal -- at a Zippin-
powered store at Barclays Center (where conference
attendees got a tour). During the tour Zippin senior vice
president of business development Gary Jacobus held
court, able to show people in a much more powerful
way what the checkout-free experience was all about.

“You can talk all you want about it, but when you bring
people to see it, their eyes light up,” Jacobus said in a
later sit-down interview at the ALSD show. “Then they
talk about maybe putting in one store and we say, ‘Be
careful -- everyone will want to go there.’ “

Stadium Tech Report knows what Jacobus is talking
about. At Empower Field at Mile High in Denver, where
Zippin has nine stores -- its most in any stadium -- the
claim that checkout-free stores “eliminate lines” is
somewhat misleading, because the stores’ popularity
among Broncos fans often sees lines forming
outside the stores, as people try to get in for the fast
concessions experience.

But such success is not entirely a bad problem, and
our guess is at most of its existing venue deployments
(which include Golden 1 Center in Sacramento, AT&T
Center in San Antonio and Barclays Center, among
others) Zippin is likely going to see more expansion.
And many of those stands may be like the five going in
at Nissan Stadium, as smaller “drink lane” deployments
designed to focus on fast delivery of beverages, mostly
cans and bottles in glass-door coolers.

At ALSD, Jacobus told us about the success of two
drink-lane stands at Barclays Center, where previously
unused space on stadium concourses was converted
into Zippin stands that can now generate as much as
$10,000 per event.

“Drink lanes are a great replacement for portable sales,
where a vendor might have only one or two brands,”
Jacobus said. “In one of our drink lanes you can have
six coolers with every SKU. And the blank space is now
revenue-generating.”

One of the facets of Zippin’s business model -- its
willingness to share transaction data with teams and
venues -- may be why the company has rapidly moved
to the top of the stadium market. (Zippin, like the other
competitors in the market, also has its technology in
other verticals, like convenience stores and airport
terminal stores.)

“We drive unbelievable data
from your store to you, and
we will always remain a
third party [provider],” said
Jacobus, whose company
offers its technology as a
subscription-type service.
“We’re not doing our own
thing.”

So far, Zippin has been hampered a bit in telling its
story since its willingness to “white label” its stores
-- at Barclays, for example, one store is branded as the
“American Express Shop,” while another Zippin store
at Petco Park in San Diego is branded by Michelob
Ultra -- keeps the Zippin name under wraps. Per some
contracts Zippin is not allowed to use the team or

venue name in promotion, but if the company keeps
growing at its current pace perhaps at some point the
secrets will become moot if Zippin becomes seen as a
preferred technology supplier.

since they’re getting more food and beverage more
easily.

“We are affecting ticket sales,” Jacobus claimed. “We
are part of the experience that makes fans want to

Along the way, Zippin
is already learning
valuable lessons from
its deployments that
it shares across its
portfolio -- like trying
to install rear-loading
coolers so they can be
more easily replenished,
usually multiple times
during a game. With
the rapid flow and
popularity of the stands,
Jacobus said, stocking
a Zippin store is much,
much different than a
traditional stand from
the past, which might
be supplied once before
the start of an event.

“You don’t run these like
a normal stand -- you
want to keep the coolers
fully stocked, and not
looking like they’re
running out,” Jacobus said.

come to games.”

AMAZON: JUST
WALK OUT EXPANDS
IN STADIUMS, BUT
MOTIVES REMAIN
UNCLEAR

With 14 of its “Just Walk
Out” stores now either
announced or open in
stadiums, it’s clear that
the sales behemoth
known as Amazon is
moving forward in the
venue concessions
market. But one of
the many unanswered
questions about the
retailer’s presence
in stadiums is the big
“why,” as in why is one
of the world’s largest
product sellers -- and
the owner of the Whole
Foods grocery chain
-- interested in the smaller
and more complex world
of stadium concessions?

tour of the Zippin store at Barclays Center. Below right: Shelves of items

And while Zippin stores
might be more complex than other offerings -- the
company still uses a combination of overhead cameras
and weight-sensitive shelving to provide what it says
is a near-100 percent rate of correct product detection
-- Jacobus said the company isn’t having any problems
proving its value proposition. In Denver, caterer
Aramark has said that its aggressive technology
deployments, of which Zippin stores are a major part,
helped Empower Field at Mile High record the highest
transaction rate per attendee of the 11 NFL stadiums
where Aramark handles food and beverage service.
And increased sales has to mean that fans are happier,

Unfortunately, despite months of trying, Stadium Tech
Report has been unable to get any answers about the
details of Amazon’s interest and presence in stadiums,
mainly because the company refuses to make executives
available for questioning. At the ALSD show in New York
Amazon was not hiding anywhere, as its mockup-store
booth on the show floor had a steady stream of visitors.

But when Stadium Tech Report requested an interview
with a Just Walk Out executive, Amazon first agreed to
the interview, only to reverse course when we showed

up the next day at the appointed time. The executive
we were supposed to interview instead referred us
to corporate PR, who responded with an email saying
they would only reply “on background,” terms to which
Stadium Tech Report did not agree to.

So now we are left with only some small bits of
information on the technology, contract and
deployment details of the Amazon stores, which
resemble the Zippin stores in that both have gated
entries and exits. At some (but not all) of its stadium
stores, Amazon allows guests enrolled in the Amazon
One platform to scan their palms for store entry.

During a tour of UBS Arena while at the ALSD show,
we did get to see an Amazon store, a pop-up type
enclosure on a concourse, one of two such stores in
the venue. Ben Miller, senior business developer for
Amazon, did answer some on-site questions about
the store, which he said did not have any shelf sensors
(“we use those in stores that have smaller items”). STR
counted at least 38 cameras installed for customer
tracking at the store.

What’s more murky are the particulars of the business
arrangement between teams, venues, caterers and
Amazon, a topic again off-limits to discussion by
any of the parties, according to them, per Amazon’s
request. At the UBS
Arena store, the only
one we’ve seen live,
Amazon branding is
front and center.

We did see one
interesting component
during our tech tour
of UBS Arena -- a
completely separate
fiber drop for the
Amazon stores in the
main telco back office
room, confirmation
that the stores
there have network

STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   SUMMER 2022     31

connections separate from the rest of the venue. We
also were not able to get anyone from any venue to
answer questions about whether or not Amazon shares
transaction data for its stores with the teams and
venues hosting the stands.

Amazon, which has also deployed the Just Walk Out
technology in some retail grocery stores -- including
at a full-size Whole Foods store in Washington, D.C.
-- has some interesting stadium stands, including a
Starbucks outlet at Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle.
But what exactly the company is seeking with its
stadium presence -- more Prime signups, more

customer data, more AWS contracts -- and what all that
means for potential team and venue partners -- are
details still unanswered.

AIFI: ADDING STORES INSIDE ARENAS

The third player in the checkout-free stadium
marketplace, a San Francisco startup called AiFi, is
getting ready to debut its first in-stadium stores this
fall, at some NFL stadiums followed by some more
deployments at NBA arenas, according to the company.

Though it has fewer stadium stores deployed than
either Zippin or Amazon, an exact total is hard to pin

a good fit for Verizon-sponsored promotion because its
camera-only technology only needs a solid connection
(like Verizon 5G) on the back end.

Alex Sophocleous, head of marketing and growth
verticals for AiFi, said the new stores coming this fall
include a mix of nanostores as well as in-venue drink
lanes and inside renovations of existing concession
spaces, all new designs for AiFi. At the time of this
interview, none of the pending U.S. market deals were
public, so announcements will have to wait. But they
are coming, according to Sophocleous.

“We’re just seeing so much demand,” he said.

Sophocleous said that AiFi’s use of only cameras for its
sports stadium stores makes it a potentially cheaper
and easier solution to deploy.

“You can use existing coolers
and shelving, and teams like
that,” Sophocleous said.

down for AiFi since the company has moved some of
its pop-up standalone stores (which the company calls
“nanostores”) to different events around the country.

If you were at football games at Detroit’s Ford Field last
season or at this year’s F1 races around Miami’s Hard
Rock Stadium, you might have purchased items at an
AiFi-powered store. While AiFi might be trailing in the
market race, it did secure a $65 million funding round
earlier this year led in part by Verizon Ventures, just part
of a close relationship between AiFi and the cellular giant.
According to both Verizon and AiFi, AiFi’s technology was

STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   SUMMER 2022     33

While AiFi does use sensors in its deployments at
convenience stores (according to Sophocleous sensors
allow faster return of customer receipts), at stadiums
the team has found that fans aren’t really looking for a
receipt the moment they leave the store.

Since teams pay for the store install for AiFi systems,
Sophocleous said the stands’ smaller networking
demands also can make it a more attractive option.
While some of its competitors require some
networking hardware on site, Sophocleous said AiFi
stands have only “a small media box” which can fit
“behind a cooler.”

Like Zippin, AiFi also provides transaction data to the
teams and venues, Sophocleous said. Given Verizon’s
large presence in the sports stadium market -- it
is a partner with the NFL and has led networking
deployments in many other venues, including NBA
arenas -- it stands to reason that thanks to its partner
AiFi already has a foot in the door at many venues.
