Stadium Connectivity Outlook Survey
Results and Analysis

RESEARCH OVERVIEW

Stadium Tech Report conducted the 2023 Stadium Connectivity Outlook survey in

partnership with Verizon. The research was conducted to ﬁnd out the "state of the stadium"

marketplace as it pertains to issues around venue connectivity and technology

deployments, including:

• What are their investment priorities in connectivity and related technologies

• What fan experience pain points can connectivity and other related technologies

help solve

• How can connectivity investments and strategy beneﬁt the business bottom line

• How can venues also solve for necessary security measures in a more-connected world

METHODOLOGY

• The survey was conducted online by Stadium Tech Report during August and

September 2023, targeting our reader audience of stadium technology professionals.

This includes people working directly for teams, schools and venues, as well as

consultants contracted to assist venues in their technology deployments.

• This was a blind data collection process. Verizon was not identiﬁed as the co-sponsor of

the survey.
