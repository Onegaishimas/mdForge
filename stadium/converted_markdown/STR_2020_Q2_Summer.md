  Welcome to the second issue of our SEVENTH year of STADIUM TECH REPORTS, the Summer 2020 issue!
These quarterly long-form reports are designed to give stadium and large public venue owners and operators, and
digital sports business executives a way to dig deep into the topic of stadium technology, via exclusive research
and profiles of successful stadium technology deployments, as well as news and analysis of topics important to this
growing market.

  Our stories for this issue include our first comprehensive look at how venue owners and operators, and teams
and schools, might find a way back to live action and fans in stadiums following the current pandemic shutdowns.
This feature is just the start of an ongoing series of research papers, interviews and other offerings of timely
information we will be grouping under the “Return to Venues” title, a series of offerings done in part through an
editorial and research partnership with AmpThink. We also have two profiles in this issue, one on the extensive
network deployments at the ready-to-open Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, and another on a new Wi-Fi 6
network deployment at Dodger Stadium. Plus an explanation of our overall name change from Mobile Sports
Report to Stadium Tech Report – read on!

EXPANDING OUR SCOPE

WELCOME TO
STADIUM TECH
REPORT!

BY PAUL KAPUSTKA

W elcome to the strangest time ever

for sports. For venue technology
professionals,  it’s  even  tougher,
since they need to not just deal
with  the  present  but  also  must
plan for the future. And that would
be  an  incredibly  uncertain  future,  with  uncertain  needs,
perhaps  fulfilled  by  untested  technologies,  which  need
to be paid for at a time when no money is coming in. All
that makes it tough to show up for work every morning.

point of our business: Our quarterly “Stadium Tech Re-
port” series, which began with a venue-by-venue survey
of  the  wireless  connectivity  at  each  NBA  arena,  and  a
few  profiles  of  deployments  at  stadiums,  including  the
brand-new  Barclays  Center.  The  simple  idea  then  re-
mains powerful today: Since deploying wireless in stadi-
ums is a complex and unique problem for each venue,
we needed time and space to tell the stories completely,
so that other technology professionals could learn and
inform their own plans and strategies.

As  much  as  we  can  from  our
home offices, we feel your pain. And
in what we hope is a good move for
us and our readers, we are taking a
big step toward providing even more
information  we  hope  will  help  you
with your jobs. As of today, the entity
formerly known as Mobile Sports Re-
port will now be known as Stadium
Tech  Report.  What  does  that  mean
for  you?  Quite  simply,  it  just  means
“more.” Let me explain, with a quick
look back at where we came from:

  With team, school and venue reps
telling us for years that wireless con-
nectivity  (or  lack  thereof)  was  one
of  the  biggest  pain  points  for  fans,
it  made  sense  to  focus  on  that  part
of  the  stadium  technology  puzzle.
Over  the  years,  we’ve  had  a  front-
row seat to all the trials and errors of
Wi-Fi and cellular deployment strat-
egies  and  told  as  many  tales  as  we
could,  covering  both  the  highs  and
the lows.

MOBILE SPORTS REPORT IS NOW
STADIUM TECH REPORT

  When I started Mobile Sports Re-
port nine years ago, we had a fairly
uncertain  focus.  The  only  thing  we
really knew was that digital technol-
ogy  would  impact  the  consumption  of  sports  in  huge
ways. It wasn’t that bold of a prediction, but what was
unclear  was  what  would  matter  most,  and  what  we
could make a business out of covering. In our business,
that means finding an audience that needs information
about a topic that matters to them. Would it be watch-
ing  football  on  your  phone?  Would  it  be  sports  social
media?  Would  it  be  figuring  out  wireless  connectivity
in stadiums? We covered a lot of topics at the start, and
the title “Mobile Sports Report” was chosen purposely to
be non-specific, giving us latitude to move wherever it
made sense to move.

In 2014, we launched what would become the focal

  Along  the  way  our  audience
steadily grew from friends and fam-
ily  at  the  start  to  a  mailing  list  now
surpassing 4,000 active members, at-
tracted we think in no small part by
our commitment to honest, objective journalism. There
is no pay to play at our house, no stories done in ex-
change  for  sponsor  dollars.  Our  business  premise  has
always been, that if you deliver a solid, honest product,
the audience will appreciate it, and sponsors will want
to reach those readers by showing their support for the
outlet of the information. The continued interest of our
readers and the continued support of our sponsors is an
honor we cherish.

But  just  like  we  called  the  main  publication  “Mo-
bile Sports Report” for flexibility, there also was a rea-
son  why  we  purposely  called  our  flagship  publication
“Stadium Tech Report,” and not something with mobility

or wireless in the title. Yes, mobility and devices will al-
ways be at the forefront of any game-day experience and
even  more  so  going  forward,  especially
as  digital  interactions  will  likely  replace
many  human  ones  for  safety  reasons  in
the near future. But now more than ever,
more technology will come into venues,
in areas only remotely related to mobility.
Scanners, digital signage and camera sys-
tems  will  become  need-to-know-about
technology  now  added  to  the  to-do  list
for IT teams inside venues. And we will
embrace those with the same direction as
we did with wireless.

It’s a subtle but necessary change. It
may not seem so to those on the outside
reading  in,  but  titles  matter.  You  are,  at
some point, what you say you are on the
biggest  sign  you  have  –  a  Restaurant,  a
Dry  Cleaner,  a  Pet  Store.  Changing  our  main  name  to
Stadium Tech Report says, out loud, that all technology
for stadiums and other large public venues is now in our
purview. That doesn’t mean we’re going to back down
at all from our perch where (in our humble estimation)
we  cover  stadium  wireless  technology  more  closely,
deeply and objectively than anyone else out there. What
the name change says is: We’re going to take the same
approach with every other technology that goes inside
the  arenas,  mainly  because  that’s  what’s  happening  to
our audience. If they need to become instant experts on
thermal  imaging  and  detection,  self-serve  concessions
operations,  or  AI-assisted  crowd  camera  systems,  we
want to help them on that learning curve.

always translate to success in the seats. You can expect
a  lot  of  this  in  the  days  to  come,  where  every  “new”
thing is touted as a savior, especially by
those without a lot of background in the
business. But will they follow up to see
if those things worked, and if not, how
venues eventually solved the problems?
Like you, we’re in this for the long haul.

For  the  nuts  and  bolts  that  matter
–  how  will  you  install  and  run  it,  how
will it be paid for, what is the total cost
of ownership, will it really be necessary
two years from now – you can count on
us  and  our  great  audience,  our  readers
who are our sources, to help figure out
what works and what doesn’t.

If you think about it in math terms,
running tech at an arena just went from
algebra  straight  to  calculus,  no  stops  in  between.  In-
stead  of  just  trying  to  figure  out  if  you  want  your  Wi-
Fi  antennas  overhead  or  under-seat,  now  you  have  to
contemplate an entirely new way of getting fans into a
stadium,  perhaps  scanning  them  for  body  temperature
or  blood-oxygen  levels  on  the  way;  you  may  have  to
completely  reroute  concourses  and  pathways  to  seats,
sometimes  in  stadiums  that  were  originally  built  over
100 years ago; And you may have to remake everything
you  ever  did  on  a  concessions  standpoint,  as  the  en-
tire world switches to contact-free payment systems and
shies away from someone taking your order face to face,
taking your money and then wrapping and handing you
a hot dog.

OUR INAUGURAL ISSUE

  Watch for more improvements as the summer rolls
on – we have some new directions coming in design and
content to better address the changing way our audience
consumes  what  we  put  on  the  table.  One  of  the  first
endeavors  is  a  joint  research/editorial  project  with  our
friends at AmpThink we are calling the “Return to Ven-
ues,” an open-ended idea to expose all the best ideas,
thinking and practices of the smartest people we know
in  the  business  in  regards  to  the  challenges  presented
by the coronavirus. We’re still in the process of putting
this  all  together,  but  stay  tuned  for  more  in-depth  re-
ports, more live or recorded interviews, and other things
all  meant  to  help  elevate  the  shared  discussion  about
where we’re all headed next.

In the narrow-focus field of stadium technology, it’s
going to be an incredible time over the next six months,
over the next year, over the next two years. There’s go-
ing to be lots of experiments, some of which may bear
fruit,  some  which  may  flame  out,  and  others  that  will
need tweaking and lots of trial and error before things
work the way they should. We’ve seen this story before,
if you think about ideas like in-seat delivery and stadi-
um apps. What sounds great in a first headline doesn’t

6      STADIUM TECH REPORT SUMMER 2020

And just for kicks, the need for all the critical wire-
less networks underlying everything doesn’t go away, it
only gets more necessary as all the new stuff like camer-
as, sensors, displays and POS terminals will need more,
not  less,  connectivity.  Same  with  outreach  to  fans  and
staff, who will all need more, not less, communication.
It’s scary stuff, almost as scary as the pandemic that has
caused the shutdown. But staying still or moving back-
wards is not an option. That’s the same for us, and it’s
why we chose this time to double down on what we do,
mainly again because what we’ve learned in a month-
plus  of  deep-dive  interviews.  Nobody  knows  what’s
happening,  there  is  no  silver  bullet,  no  single  plan  of
action.  It’s  going  to  take  a  lot  more  Zoom  calls,  trials,
errors, adjustments and re-adjustments until we get it fig-
ured out.

The one thing to me that makes this industry different
from other tech-specific markets is that its practicioners
share information with each other like no other. We’ll do
our best to help that process along at a time when it’s
needed more than ever. Join us at our new home – same
as the old place, just with more room and an expanded
menu. Welcome, then, to Stadium Tech Report! –STR–

?WHAT’S

THE UNCERTAIN PATH FORWARD
IN THE ‘RETURN TO VENUES’

BY PAUL KAPUSTKA

WHAT’S NEXT?
RETURN TO VENUES

A s  the  world  enters  the  summer  of

the  global  coronavirus  pandemic,
there  is  only  one  thing  certain  in
the world of large public venues and
mass-attendance  events:  Nobody,
anywhere,  has  any  complete  idea
what is going on right now, or exactly what the future
holds for live audiences at sporting events or concerts.

To  be  sure,  sports  of  all  kinds  are  starting  to  test
the waters on how they might return to action after the
coronavirus shutdowns, and eventually how they might
start welcoming fans back into their venues. But without
any  coherent  top-down  direction  from  the  federal
government,  the  current  state  of  how  fans  will  return
to  venues  in  the  U.S.  is  an  uncoordinated  chaos,  with
teams, leagues, schools, governments and fans all trying
to  find  a  way  forward  on  their  own  that  balances  the
need  for  safety  (we  hope)  with  the  desire  to  see  live
events in person.

After conducting a wide-ranging series of interviews
with subject matter experts, industry thought leaders and
representatives from teams, schools, leagues and venues
over the past couple months, Stadium Tech Report has
come to some early conclusions about what the remainder

FANS AGAIN? THIS PAGE: LINES OUTSIDE OKLAHOMA’S

of  2020  and  beyond  might  look  like  for  the  world  of
professional and big-school sports. While all of these are
still  only  best  guesses  as  to  what  might  happen,  there
are some trends that seem to be the way most operations
will proceed as the search for a vaccine or some other
type of coronavirus cure or treatment goes on.

1. Get ready for events without any fans,
maybe until next year.

In our research partnership with AmpThink (see Bill
Anderson  column  in  this  issue)  Stadium  Tech  Report
agrees that the AmpThink-developed theory of a “stages
of  return”  process  is  what  we  think  most  venues  will
need  to  go  through  in  order  to  safely  start  allowing
fans  to  attend  events  again.  The  first  two  parts  of  that
process, getting government approval to open the doors
to crowds and satisfying liability issues surrounding the
safety of people in any building, are a combination that
we see likely to push many venues into hosting events
without fans – or in some cases, with severely restricted
numbers  of  fans  –  since  having  only  competitors  and
necessary  staff,  and  perhaps  a  small  number  of  fans
inside the venues is likely an order of magnitude easier
(and cheaper) to accomplish.

  Granted, there are many sports and concert operations
that may not have any incentive to hold events without
fans,  since  their  revenue  models  may  lean  heavily  on
game-day spending for food and beverage. However, the
bigger sports with big TV deals would at least be able

to  earn  some  percentage  of  their  incomes  by  holding
empty-stadium events that would still be broadcast. Both
NASCAR and the PGA have plans for limited-fan events,
but none have yet taken place as of this writing.

At the start of June the NBA and the MLS took the
biggest  steps  forward  with  solid  plans  to  finish  their
seasons in a “bubble” type atmosphere in Orlando, where
teams  would
be  sequestered
and
would
play  at  close-
by
facilities.
The  NHL  and
League
Major
Baseball also traded ideas between owners and players
for similar shortened seasons, with most plans from all
leagues pointing to live action sometime by July.

POLLS ARE SHOWING THAT
A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE
ARE STILL IN FAVOR OF
RESTRICTING BUSINESS
ACTIVITY TO KEEP EVERY-
ONE SAFE FROM THE VIRUS.

The key thing similar to all the ideas? As of the first
week of June, nothing was yet fully determined because
of all the variables that still needed to be addressed. And
even if league owners and players come to agreements
on  revenue  shares,  safety  procedures  and  plans  for
determining a champion, some of those plans still face
huge  hurdles  when  it  comes  to  legal  jurisdictions  and
health-department concerns, factors that may still leave
some sports facing even shorter seasons or at worst, full
season cancellations.

Since President Trump’s administration has made no
effort to provide any type of national guidance for the
re-opening of businesses, the result in sports is an ever-
changing  overlap  of  directions,  with  some  governors
proclaiming that their states are ready to host big events
with fans in stands, while other state and international
leaders are saying that they won’t allow big public events
like sports and concerts to have fans in attendance until
perhaps 2021. College conferences that span several states
are already trying to confront the scheduling confusion
that may arise if some schools are in states ready to host
events, while others are in states where large events are
still closed for safety reasons.

No  matter  what  the  state  or  local

governments  decide,  satisfying  the
combination of the second stage of the
“return to venues” model – addressing
the  legal  liability  of  the  venues  –
and  the  third  stage,  which  is  gaining
confidence  of  the  fans  –  will  likely  push  many  venues
to  hold  fan-free  events  first,  while  they  work  on  plans
and technology deployments to help get them to a place
where  they  can  earn  government  approval  to  open,  to
feel legally confident that they can keep fans safe, and
then convince fans of that feeling.

  While there  will always likely be some fans willing
to attend events no matter what the risk is, with national
polls  showing  that  a  majority  of  people  in  the  country

TAILGATE AREAS, LIKE THIS ONE LAST YEAR AT LEVI’S STADIUM, WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY CHANGE WITH
SOCIAL-DISTANCING RESTRICTIONS IN PLACE. CREDIT: BRIAN NITENSON, STR

are  still  in  favor  of  restricting  business  activity  to  keep
everyone safe from the virus, it might not make business
sense for venues to try to open widely if big crowds don’t
want to show up just yet. And events with less than full-
house attendance may also not be economically feasible
for  many  venues,  given  the  large  costs  associated  with
just opening the doors of a stadium-sized facility; if you
can’t make enough money to cover costs with a smaller
audience, does it make sense to hold the event at all?

So just from a baseline measure of costs, safety and
operational  complexity,  the  feedback  we’ve  received
from  our  interviews  leads  us  to  guess  that  most  “big”
events for the rest of the year will have no fans or strictly
limited, small amounts of fans in attendance, if the events
happen at all.

2. When fans do return to venues,
new technologies and processes will
be required, especially for venue entry
and for concessions.
  When  it  comes  to  social  distancing  to  keep  the  virus
from spreading, at large public venues it’s all about the lines.

  With the prospect of an all-clear vaccine a year away
at best, after some time the economic pressures of the
current  closures  will  become  untenable  if  teams  and
venues want to survive as businesses. So, opening venues
to  some  number  of  fans  before  a  vaccine  is  available
seems extremely likely; and in all discussions we’ve had
so far, it’s apparent that venues believe they will need to
enforce  social  distancing  among  guests,  much  like  we
are all doing in various phases of public activity today.

12      STADIUM TECH REPORT SUMMER 2020

In seating areas, social distancing will be an easier

task, given that venues can more easily keep seats
unsold or erect barriers to keep unrelated groups
apart  from  each  other.  The  real  problem  with
social distancing in stadiums comes from lines, a
historical  commonplace  occurence  at  entryways,
on concourses and at places like concession stands and
restrooms.  To  eliminate  lines  and  to  keep  guests  from
inadvertently getting too close to one another, venues are
likely going to need to deploy some kind of combination
of technology and procedures to streamline the logjams
we  all  used  to  just  tolerate  as  part  of  the  game-day
experience.

Since the terrorist attacks of 9/11, entry to almost all
stadiums in the U.S. has become a more lengthy procedure
than it was before thanks to the use of metal detectors.
Physical checks of handbags or large coats have further
slowed entry procedures in general, as have newer forms
of  identification  for  digital  ticketing  that  required  a  live
network connection at the point of ticket scanning.

Even in the face of all those barriers, many fans at big
events still waited until near start time at tailgate parties
or other outside-the-venue events, leading to large traffic
jams of fans at the entry doors near the starting times.
To allow fans to attend large events during a pandemic,
however, fans may be asked to arrive even earlier to go
through more thorough security checks that may include
new procedures for temperature scans and perhaps even
blood  oxygen-level  scanning;  some  venues  may  even
choose  to  implement  on-the-spot  testing  for  Covid-19,
new  procedures  that  will  likely  force  many  venues  to

expand  the  geographic  area  needed  to  support  all  the
new entry procedures.

since  such  deployments  will  probably  remain  popular
even after concerns about virus transmissions subside.

  New  technologies,  some  of  which  have  already
been put in use in limited deployments, may offer some
help  in  entryway  procedures.  The  use  of  near-field
communications (NFC) systems to allow personal devices
to be scanned for valid tickets without having to present
the  devices  could  theoretically  significantly  speed  up
entry lines, with the caveat being that fans would have to
adopt such payment or ticketing systems before arriving.
Other venues are also looking at newer forms of threat-
detection devices like metal detectors that can scan groups
of  people  at  a  single  pass  instead  of  the  airport-style
o n e - p e r s o n
is
gate
c u r r e n t l y
the  de
facto
standard. A no-
tech additional
solution  being
considered  by
other venues is the idea of reserved or staggered entry
times, which could streamline the process if fans are able
to  or  forced  to  comply.  Similar  methods  have  already
been proposed for departure, with fans being instructed
by section or row by row when it’s safe to leave.

that

The idea of entering at any gate and being able to
wander around the entire stadium may also be something
eliminated  during  a  social-distancing  audience  phase.
Some  venues  are  considering  highly  regulated  “zones”
inside  venues  to  keep  fans  apart.  What  is  true  of  all
plans, technology-aided or not, is that any new measures
will require huge amounts of communication outreach to
fans, a large amount of training and even new staffing
for stadium workforces, and a new level of compliance,
regulation and policing, all extra-cost measures during a
time of significantly reduced revenues.

The contact-free concessions experience
  Over the past year or so, many large public venues
have  already  tested  or  had  small  deployments  of  so-
called  “contact-free”  concessions  technologies,  where
fans could order and pay for concessions via their mobile
device,  then  either  picking  up  orders  at  a  specified
window or having orders delivered to their seats. Other
stadiums have already experimented with various forms
of  “grab  and  go”  concessions  stands,  where  pre-made
items are offered for fans to take, with some deployments
also featuring self-scan payment options.

The  general  idea  of  having  fewer  or  no  human
interactions at all for concessions transactions will likely
be the most widespread technology and process change
for  venues  opening  up  during  the  pandemic.  For  most
of  the  venue  representatives  we  spoke  to,  plans  that
were  already  in  place  for  some  move  to  contact-free
concessions  operations  will  likely  just  be  accelerated

A nother trend that had already started

in some venues and will likely only
accelerate due to pandemic concerns
is the move to “cash free” operations,
where only digital payment methods
are  allowed.  Though  some  states
have laws prohibiting the complete elimination of cash
payments  inside  venues,  it  will  be  interesting  to  see
whether  security  and  health  concerns  about  the  virus-
spreading  possibility  of  exchanging  cash  will  force
changes to those regulations. Some stadiums that have
started cash-free operations have provided reverse-ATM
type machines where cash can be deposited and stored
on a machine-produced debit card for use in that venue.
But those machines are costly to operate, and may not be
necessary if opposition to cash-free operations declines.

  One  area  of  food  service  where  there  isn’t  much
consensus  yet  on  what  is  to  come  is  the  area  of  club
and other premium spaces, which in the past few years
have  mainly  trended  toward  buffet-style  offerings,
sometimes as part of an all-inclusive cost system. While
safety concerns have some observers predicting an early
demise for the large-venue buffet, others see possibilities
of  having  more  closely  staffed  buffet  operations,  like
the  cafeterias  of  the  past  where  a  server  (most  likely
behind  a  glass  shield)  can  prepare  individual  plates.
Premium suite services are also seen as an area heading
for massive changes, with more prepackaged food and
beverage options likely instead of the traditional steam-
tray or open-serve catered offerings previously found in
most venues.

3. Critical networks will be needed to
support everything new and old

If  there  ever  really  was  a  question  about  whether
or  not  wireless  networks  were  needed  inside  venues,
the  advent  of  the  coronavirus  pandemic  has  removed
all doubt. According to several sources we’ve talked to,
some  networking  deployments  or  upgrade  plans  that
had  been  “on  the  fence”  prior  to  the  outbreak  have
now been quickly green-lighted, as venues everywhere
realize that critical networks will be even more important
going forward, as new technologies and new procedures
demand increased levels of connectivity.

  On  the  technology  side,  it  is  clear  that  if  venues
are  looking  to  add  new  layers  of  devices  like  sensors
and  threat  detectors,  there  is  going  to  be  a  need  for
greater wireless connectivity, sometimes in new areas of
the  venue  that  may  not  have  previously  had  a  priority
for  bandwidth.  Entry  areas  in  particular,  and  perhaps
also  spaces  just  outside  venues,  will  likely  need  more
carrier-class connectivity going forward, as venues seek
to  automate  more  transactions  like  ticket-taking  and
parking payments.

STADIUM TECH REPORT   SUMMER 2020     13

Installation of more mobile concessions technology,
like kiosks and even vending machines, will also increase
the need for overall connectivity, as will a shift to more
fans using mobile devices for concessions ordering and
payments as described previously. Venues are also likely
going to want to increase the amount of digital displays in
their buildings, to assist with crowd control, wayfinding
and  social-distancing  policing  –  again  leading  to  more
demand for both wired and wireless connectivity.

IF VENUES ADD NEW
LAYERS OF DEVICES LIKE
SENSORS AND THREAT
DETECTORS, THERE IS
GOING TO BE A NEED
FOR GREATER WIRELESS
CONNECTIVITY.

Layer in more increases in communication demands
just  from  a  fan-education  standpoint  as  well  as  any
growth  in  demand
for public safety and
other
operational
needs  and  it’s  clear
that  providing  or
upgrading  existing
networks to a much
more robust state is
probably the first to-do item on many venues’ work lists
as they seek to support the return to venues. The good
news is, from a technology and market perspective, there
may not be a better time to be seeking new horsepower
and capacity on a wireless-networking front.

  On the Wi-Fi side, the advent of Wi-Fi 6 networking
gear  –  now  available  from  most  top  vendors  –  should
provide  a  large  boost  in  performance  and  capacity  for
venue  networks,  at  costs  only  slightly  higher  than  the
past generation of equipment.

  On  the  cellular  side,  4G  DAS  networks  remain  a
key tool in bringing a multi-carrier solution to providing
basic access to most devices, while the arrival of nascent
5G services will enable carriers and venues to bring new
kinds of services to guests, including applications with
low-latency  needs  like  virtual  reality  and  other  high-
bandwidth broadcasts. Also, the emergence of networks
using  the  CBRS  bandwidth  for  potential  “private”  LTE
networks may provide venues with an additional method
of  adding  secure,  standards-based  communications  for
things  like  back-of-house  operations,  in-venue  gaming,
and Wi-Fi like services or Wi-Fi backhaul to areas where
Wi-Fi signals can’t reach.

  While  budgetary  concerns,  venue  aesthetics  and
demand for levels of services will still likely make overall
networking choices a very local decision, the idea of trying
to move forward in a pandemic age without a high level of
basic wireless connectivity seems to be a non-starter.

4. What is the new normal? What will the
“cover of Covid” change for good?

Perhaps  the  most  interesting  technological  or
procedural shifts that may occur in the pandemic’s wake
are  ones  that  are  not  taken  solely  to  address  safety  or
other  virus  concerns,  but  ones  that  use  the  crisis  as  a
reason to fix things about venues that have been “broken”

14      STADIUM TECH REPORT SUMMER 2020

or continued without question simply because “that’s the
way we’ve always done things.”

  Our good friend Bob Jordan came up with the line
of  “what  will  be  done  under  the  cover  of  Covid”  that
will not just help venues support the return of fans, but
will also address problems that may have been around
for ages? Jordan is quick to note that the basic format of
stadiums hasn’t changed much since the days when the
Romans built the Coliseum, with lots of things like small
numbers  of  entryways  and  traffic-snarling  collisions  of
perpendicular  paths  (like  those  found  on  concourses
when people stop and turn to get to a concession stand)
still  persisting  in  almost  every  venue  today.  Will  the
pandemic  force  venues  to  completely  change  the  way
people  walk  around  in  venues?  Will  those  changes
persist if they simply represent a better way to do things
that hadn’t been thought of before?

Similarly, might not things like timed entries and exits
be seen as an attractive alternative compared to a future
where we just go back to logjams because it’s safe to be
close to people again? Will there be any fans who want
to go back to the “old way” of waiting in a line to order
a hot dog, and then going through the additional waiting
of  having  someone  turn  around,  wrap  your  food,  and
take your payment? Or will the shift to a more self-service
model – perhaps with fewer choices – become part of the
“new normal” that will appear on the other side?

  How many other ideas that were put off due to budget
constraints or historical opposition will get tested, now
that Covid-19 is a “good excuse” to give them a try? And
how many others will still stay on the sidelines, hedging
bets against any new methods or expenditures in a time
of reduced revenues, waiting for things to pass?

A s we said at the start – right now, the

only thing everyone knows for sure
is  that  nobody  knows  anything  for
sure. From our interviews, however,
it is very apparent that for almost all
the  people  we  have  talked  to,  few
see standing still as a viable alternative. There are almost
assuredly going to be some missteps, some money and
time spent on technologies or procedures that don’t pan
out,  some  anger  and  frustration  on  all  sides,  as  we  all
adjust to new ways of doing things we’d long taken for
granted.  There  will  also  be  successful  moves,  victories
small and big, which we hope to share to help accelerate
the “Return to Venues” as much as possible.

  Here at Stadium Tech Report, nothing has changed
in  our  core  directive  –  trying  to  help  bring  the  best
information  possible  to  our  readers  so  that  they  can
be  successful  in  operating  their  venues.  Stay  tuned  as
we  try  to  find  as  many  ways  as  possible  to  keep  that
communication flowing. –STR–

LIFE
FIELD

READY FOR DEBUT WHEN
BASEBALL RETURNS

BY PAUL KAPUSTKA

THE TEXAS RANGERS’ NEW HOME,
GLOBE LIFE FIELD IN ARLINGTON, TEXAS

GLOBE LIFE FIELD
READY FOR DEBUT

WHEN FANS ARE FINALLY ALLOWED BACK IN STADIUMS TO
WATCH BASEBALL AGAIN, GLOBE LIFE FIELD WILL BE READY.

T he venue perhaps most affected by the

coronavirus-related shutdown of sports,
Major  League  Baseball’s  newest  stadi-
um  will  offer  visitors  state-of-the-art
wireless  connectivity,  including  a  Wi-
Fi 6 network using gear from Aruba, a
Hewlett Packard Enterprise company. Cellular coverage
will be provided by a 4G LTE distributed antenna sys-
tem  deployed  by  DAS  Group  Professionals  using  gear
from JMA, with 5G systems slated for deployment later in
the year. The technology deployments were directed by
CenturyLink’s venue integration team, and CenturyLink
is also providing a unique backbone bandwidth deploy-
ment for the venue with three regionally separate links
for greater redundancy.

  Originally scheduled to open in March of this year,
the  new  $1.2  billion  home  of  the  Texas  Rangers  –  a
40,300-seat  venue  with  a  transparent,  retractable  roof
that  makes  Globe  Life  Field  more  than  just  a  baseball
stadium – now sits waiting by its neighbors in Arlington,
Texas, part of a complex that includes AT&T Stadium as
well as Globe Life Park, the Rangers’ former home.

“We  are  ready  to  put  on  a  game  today,”  said  Mike
Bullock, Vice President, Information Technology for the
Rangers.

After a planned March 14 concert with Chris Staple-
ton along with Willie Nelson and Friends was canceled
on March 12, the venue has been mostly closed, though

BRING CONNECTIVITY TO MOST OF THE SEATING BOWL.

it did open up to host high-school graduation ceremo-
nies at the end of May.

Though  baseball  overall  this  year  might  start  with-
out  fans  in  the  stands,  once  guests  are  safely  allowed
back in venues the experience at Globe Life Field should
be among the best in the league, at least from a wire-
less-connectivity and digital fan-experience standpoint.

In addition to the Wi-Fi 6 network, which will have
approximately  1,200  APs,  most  running  the  new  stan-
dard, the DAS will have the top three carriers – AT&T,
Verizon and T-Mobile – on the network when the doors
open, Bullock said. The Rangers also worked with app
developer  Venuetize  as  well  as  MLB’s  digital  team  to
produce an enhanced version of the MLB Ballpark app,
which will support features like a digital wallet, in-seat
ordering,  and  delivery  of  merchandise  to  a  system  of
lockers inside the stadium.

For digital displays, the Rangers partnered with Dak-
tronics, which has installed two large boards – the bigger
one, in right field, measures 58 feet by 150 feet, while the
left-field board measures 40 feet by 111 feet. According to
Daktronics  both  boards  use  15  millimeter  spacing,  and
combined provide 5.2 million pixels over 13,000 square
feet of display. The venue also has a 2.5-foot high ribbon
board that stretches from foul pole to foul pole along the

seating area, a 925-foot long span; another ribbon board
on the suite level stretches 211 feet. Daktronics also pro-
vided some 1,400 LCD TV screens throughout the venue.

Finding the best equipment and design
  Unlike some other MLB parks that are in the midst of
network upgrades, the Rangers and Globe Life Field are
not a part of the new MLB “2.0” tech consortium, where
like it did several years ago, the league brings in carrier
and equipment partners to share deployment costs with
the teams.

According to Bullock the new-version MLB consor-
tium plans weren’t yet in place when the Rangers needed
to start moving forward with Globe Life Field’s technolo-
gy decisions.

“We  have  a  good  relationship  [with  MLB]  but  our
plans  came  at  kind  of  a  gap,”  said  Bullock,  who  gave
high praise to MLB for its efforts to help bring connectiv-
ity to ballparks.

Instead,  the  Rangers  signed  up  CenturyLink  as  its
“technology innovation partner,” for professional services
including  the  design  and  RFP  stage,  engineering,  and
“hands-on” install of the Wi-Fi network. CenturyLink also
put together the data center and backbone bandwidth for
the venue, which includes two 100-Gbps pipes as well as
a third link that can be lit up should the need arise.

18      STADIUM TECH REPORT SUMMER 2020

Chip  Swisher,  Smart  Solutions  Practice  Director  for
CenturyLink, said there are two active paths coming into
the complex, with the ability to add the third later if need-
ed. The active pipes go both east and west to separate
POPs; both are 10 Gbps burstable to 40 Gbps, and can be
increased up to 100 Gbps. The third route, Swisher said,
can provide an additional 40 Gbps.

“It’s really focused on resiliance, to engineer around
any possible local peering failure. We’re probably the first
venue to do that,” said Bullock. “It’s a pretty cool design.”

Swisher, meanwhile, jokes that with the triple-back-
bone design, the venue “has more bandwidth than some
countries.”

According  to  Swisher,  CenturyLink  helped  Bullock
and the Rangers with the vendor selection process, espe-
cially for Wi-Fi equipment. Though Swisher said that all
major vendors were considered, in the end the Rangers
went with Aruba. Bullock said that approximately 600 of
the stadium’s Wi-Fi APs are deployed under-seat in the
bowl area.

Swisher said the entire Wi-Fi network was assem-
bled  and  tested  at  a  local  CenturyLink  central  office,
with  switches  and  firewalls  pre-programmed  so  that
the equipment could be delivered to the stadium ready
to install.

BACK-END WIRING SYSTEMS AT GLOBE LIFE FIELD WERE DESIGNED WITH FUTURE EXPANSION IN MIND.

“We palletized it all, IDF by IDF, and took that to the

venue,” said Swisher.

  On the DAS side of the equation the Rangers part-
nered with DGP, which used JMA gear for the 4G LTE
DAS deployment. Bullock said the Rangers also installed
some MatSing antennas for coverage in two specific ar-
eas:  the  plaza  area  at  the  main  entrance,  and  for  the
stadium “floor” or field area.

“Since we are going to be an all-digital ticket venue,
we were kind of paranoid [about wireless coverage] for
the entry area,” Bullock said. “And since this is a mixed-
use venue we also needed field coverage.”

Thanks to a quirk in the building’s construction, the
Rangers  have  something  other  venue  IT  departments
may envy: Plenty of space for the head-end room.

“We  wanted  to  make  sure  we  weren’t  cramped  on
space  here  and  as  it  worked  out  the  [head-end]  room
is at the end of the building, and it’s 8,000 square feet,”
Bullock said.

More features for Ballpark app

Another  technology  debut  awaiting  the  arrival  of
fans  to  Globe  Life  Field  is  the  Rangers’  version  of  the
MLB Ballpark app, the app used league-wide for game-
day services. According to Bullock the Rangers worked

with both the league as well as with app developer Ven-
uetize  for  some  custom  enhancements  to  the  Ballpark
app, including the wallet feature, the ability for fans in
some certain select premium seating areas to order food
delivered to their seats, and also for retail merchandise
to be purchased via the app and then stored in a locker
for fan pickup.

  On the concessions side of the house, Bullock said the
Rangers selected Appetize for its point-of-sale systems.

  While  the  pandemic-related  shutdown  is  certainly
one of the biggest obstacles to ever face a new stadium,
the construction of Globe Life Field included some oth-
er  roadblocks  for  the  crews  to  get  by,  including  some
torrential rainstorms that briefly flooded some computer
rooms and a small fire on the roof structure.

But now, the stadium is ready to go – it got a trial
run by hosting local high school graduation ceremonies
at the end of May – and Bullock can’t wait to have fans in
the stands so his team can do the final network tuning,
which requires a full house.

“We’re  ready  for  opening  day,  whenever  that  is,”

Bullock said. –STR–

SPECIAL COMMENTARY

WHAT’S NEXT
THE RETURN
TO VENUES

BY BILL ANDERSON
President, AmpThink

O n  March  11,  2020,  a

full  house  of  fans  had
filled Chesapeake Ener-
gy  Arena  in  Oklahoma
City,  in  anticipation  of
an NBA game between
the Thunder and the visiting Utah Jazz. But
just  before  tipoff,  the  referees  convened  at
midcourt for a discussion. Soon after that, the
teams  were  sent  back  to  the  locker  rooms,
and eventually an announcement was made
that the game was cancelled. A player on the
Jazz, Rudy Gobert, had tested positive for the coronavi-
rus, an incident that sent the fans home from the venue
that night – and ultimately, signaled the end of attending
spectator sports as we knew it, for the foreseeable future.

  What  followed  in  short  order  was  the  closing  of
worldwide economies and social structures as people ev-
erywhere entered stay-at-home quarantines designed to
help stop the spread of the disease. All kinds of business-
es, especially those like sports events, concerts and other
activities involving large public groups, were effectively
shut down, with no clear path to a future of when and
how they might resume.

  Now, as some of the positive effects of the quaran-
tines are being realized, societies around the world are
asking  when  and  how  more  business  and  recreational
activities  can  resume.  And  while  social-distancing  best
practices that have emerged in places like grocery stores
have provided a model that might allow more businesses
to safely serve more customers, the idea of large groups
of fans assembling packed together in stadiums during a
pandemic presents a much tougher challenge.

  While  the  desire  to  return  to  the  trib-
al  gatherings  of  sports,  concerts  and  other
events  is  widespread,  the  timing  of  the  “re-
turn  to  venues”  is  still  unknown.  The  con-
versations  around  this  topic  are  numerous
and  diverse,  and  involve  many  factors  and
factions, including politics, government, eco-
nomics, biological science, venue operations,
and personal safety. While AmpThink is not
be in a position to solve the myriad problems
that must be addressed, we do see that tech-
nology will have a significant role in the

final solution. And that role will be layered.

  Unfortunately,  right  now  much  of  the  discussion
around  technology  for  venue  security  is  increasingly
one-dimensional, searching for a silver bullet that doesn’t
exist.  Heat-sensing  cameras,  robotic  cleaners,  disinfec-
tant  chemicals  and  mobile-device  tracking  applications
may all have a role, but no single solution solves the
problem of “when will fans return” because there
isn’t one problem. Technology will just be one part of
a larger solution set.

Starting in late March, AmpThink kicked

off a partnership with Stadium Tech Re-
port to look at the future of large public
gatherings.  The  goal  of  the  effort  was
to have meaningful discussions with in-
dustry thought leaders to understand the
framework for our collective “return to venues.” We are
attempting  to  develop  that  understanding  through  the
lens  of  decision  makers  who  will  control  the  process.
We’ve  broken  our  analysis  into  “stages  of  return.”  This
phrase  reminds  us  of  the  top  level  concerns  that  must

STADIUM TECH REPORT   SUMMER 2020     21

be  addressed  before  the  “return  to  venues”  can  occur,
including: government approval; legal liability mitigation;
and the restoration of fan confidence.

ues, the decision was not arrived at lightly. Buildings will
be opening under plans that materially reduce the threat
of mass infection at a public venue.

What is it is going to take for the govern-
ment to allow public venues to open?
  While venues can propose their own paths to open-
ing their doors to fans, their ability to execute is premised
on the assumption that they will be allowed to open their
doors. Though opinions on readiness will likely be dif-
ferent from national and local perspectives, the decision
to open the doors of venues will rest heavily on the abil-
ity to convince public health authorities that the risks of
spreading an infection can be managed to the point that
they believe  that  the benefits of gathering  a crowd are
not outweighed by the risks of the gathering.

Achieving this approval will require that venues are
able to explain how the venue will identify and then
mitigate  the  risks  of  mass  public  gatherings.  This
can be achieved on an ad-hoc basis and progress will oc-
cur at different speeds in different jurisdictions. However,
establishing a national mandate, a framework, and a plan
to measure execution can move the conversation along
faster – achieving an accelerated return to venues.

If the government says yes to opening
a venue, what liability does the venue
have and what does it need to do to miti-
gate the risk?

Any responsible venue operator or owner has to ask
if the gains to be made by opening the venue will out-
weigh  the  risks.  Mortgage  payments  and  balance  sheet
pressures will influence the decision, but the legal risks
will not be ignored.

After addressing official mandates, venue owners and
operators  must  be  confident  that  they  can  safely  open
their building. And then, if and when the worst-case sce-
nario  happens  –  infection  of  some  group  of  attendees
– they can answer the tough questions regarding the ex-
ecution of their plan. Who implemented the plan, how
was it implemented, how was its effectiveness measured,
were  the  plan  elements  repeatable,  was  training  suffi-
cient? The answers could save or damn the venue both
legally and in the court of public opinion.

  Having  a  government-endorsed  strategy,  a  well-ar-
ticulated plan, and a mechanism to document execution
will  provide  venue  owners  and  operators  with  the  le-
gal confidence that they require to open their buildings,
and to provide a clear sense of responsibility toward the
guests they will invite inside their doors.

Assuming there is an open venue, what
has to happen to cause fans to become
comfortable with attending a live event?

It  is  likely  that  if  public  health  officials  and  venue
owners have reached the decision to re-open public ven-

22      STADIUM TECH REPORT SUMMER 2020

  However, fans may remain wary and without an ef-
fective vaccine, fans may prefer the comfort (and safety)
of their home to the live venue experience.

Communication of the efforts to identify and address
the risk of exposure to an infected attendee, proactively
identify  exposed  fans,  and  otherwise  reduce  the  risks
of attendance will need to be effectively communicated.
While much of the communication will focus on reach-
ing fans before they arrive at the building, their experi-
ence  when  they  reach  the  venue  will  be  an  important
part  of  developing  momentum,  using  fans  to  build  the
case that the return to venues is safe.

How technology will help enable the
‘stages of return’

Emerging  technologies  that  addresses  critical  prob-
lems  for  venues  relating  to  coronavirus  (for  example
threat  identification,  threat  mitigation,  sanitation,  track-
ing and contact tracing, messaging, and communication)
will take center stage in the coming months. But behind
these point solutions there will be a need to build
networking  infrastructure  to  make  their  products
work. Devices will need to be connected (for power, or
by wire or over the air for networks), traffic will need to
be  transported,  compute  resources  deployed,  and  sys-
tems built. The success of these systems will depend
on  architecting  reliable,  scalable,  service  provider
class networks in these venues.

What is the new normal?

Is  the  current  shutdown  permanent?  Will  all  future
events be held without fans in attendance? Likely no! But
returning fans to LPVs will take time and require a
plan  that  addresses  the  needs  of  all  stakeholders:
Government officials, venue owners and operators,
team owners, concert promoters, leagues, athletes
and  musicians,  venue  employees  and  contractors,
and of course fans.

O n behalf of our customers, we can

listen,  learn,  and  position  them  to
execute  on  a  strategy  that  gets  us
all  to  a  common  goal  –  the  open-
ing  our  stadiums,  arenas,  conven-
tion centers, malls, and other public
places  to  the  public  within  a  framework  that  manages
the risk that we pose to each other when faced with a
pandemic. Stay tuned as we present more findings of our
ongoing  research  and  interviews  with  thought  leaders,
subject matter experts, technology company leaders and
venue,  team  and  school  IT  professionals  in  the  weeks
and months to come. –STR–

UP THE ANTE
WITH
MLB’S FIRST
WI-FI 6

BY TERRY SWEENEY

GETS WI-FI 6

P rofessional  sports  may  have  put

games  and  exhibitions  on  hold,
but a handful of IT executives from
Major  League  Baseball  teams  have
been  using  pandemic  downtime  to
upgrade  Wi-Fi  and  DAS  systems  in
their stadiums.

Case  in  point:  The  Los  Angeles  Dodgers  just  com-
pleted the league’s first Wi-Fi 6 overhaul along with add-
ing  new  5G  cellular  antennas  to  ensure  Blue  Believers
stay  seamlessly  connected  to  social  media,  email,  text
and good old-fashioned voice calls during home games.

“We’re up against the same challenges that every sta-
dium has, which is how to deal with the density of in-
dividuals trying to connect simultaneously – a challenge
that’s unique to our industry,” explained Ralph Esquibel,
vice president of IT for the Dodgers. “Wi-Fi 6 was created
for this kind of high-density environment.”

  Wi-Fi 6, better known in IEEE circles as the 802.11ax
standard, is a significant upgrade for Wi-Fi networks that
started appearing last year. Among its benefits are that
use  of  the  new  standard  can  increase  the  amount  of
available spectrum and number of channels available for
users;  it  can  also  significantly  accelerate  users’  average
data rates, while also decreasing the amount of battery
power used by devices searching for a Wi-Fi connection.

As long as they have newer phones that support the new
standard,  Wi-Fi  6  networks  provide  everything  a  team
could want for its connection-conscious fans.

Replacing the Wi-Fi 4 network

It’s been barely five years since the Dodgers installed
Wi-Fi  4  in  the  stadium,  making  use  of  under-seat  APs
and what were the league’s first APs cleverly concealed
inside  hand  railings  for  even  denser  coverage.  There
were about 900 APs powering the network then, which
easily  accommodated  8,000  simultaneous  users  on  its
maiden voyage.

“It  was  state  of  the  art  back  at  that  point  in  time,”
Esquibel recalled. But usage and uptake quickly soared
among fans and it wasn’t long before 30,000 simultane-
ous users were contending for bandwidth at each game.

“That  was  when  I’d  get  a  call  from  previous  own-
ership,  usually  sometime  in  the  second  inning  with,  ‘I
can’t  get  on  email  or  make  a  phone  call…’,”  Esquibel
laughed. Suddenly, it didn’t matter how close your seat
was to home plate; anybody watching the game became
inadvertent victims of Wi-Fi’s highly successful rollout at
Dodger Stadium.

  Other baseball stadiums experienced similar capaci-
ty and uptake issues. That’s in part what prompted MLB

ogy  upgrades  to  make  sure  baseball  fans  could  do  all
the wireless networking they wanted to while watching
a game. Though MLB did not respond to a request for
more information, STR was able to get some information
from other sources about the pending upgrade plans.

the  costs  around.  Esquibel  wouldn’t  specify  any  dollar
amounts for the Dodgers’ Wi-Fi 6 budget or whether the
league contributed anything. He did note that the team
negotiated an upgrade clause into its previous Wi-Fi net-
working contract.

Wi-Fi 6 coming to more ballparks

According to our sources, MLB technologists settled
on Wi-Fi 6 upgrades as their next strategic push. So while
the Dodgers will be the first baseball team to upgrade
to Wi-Fi 6, other teams were also reportedly in the first
steps of adding Wi-Fi 6 before the coronavirus pandemic
put a hold on many upgrade plans.

It’s unclear if the MLB technology committee brought
any financial help to the table along with their wireless
expertise for these six upgrades. When MLB put togeth-
er a consortium to bring wireless connectivity to parks
starting back in 2014, it got financial buy-in from wireless
carriers,  equipment  vendors  and  teams  to  help  spread

Construction  for  the  Dodgers’  new  network  began
last fall, right after the Dodgers lost to the Washington
Nationals  in  the  NLDS  playoffs.  Back  then,  there  were
880 APs that comprised the Wi-Fi 4 network; the upgrade
to Wi-Fi 6 bumped that total closer to 1,100 APs, Esquibel
said. The Dodgers installed 9100 series APs from Cisco in
most of the same locations, reusing the cabling and con-
duits in the process. The Dodgers also replaced network
switches  (Cisco  again,  and  its  9300  switching  line)  to
handle greater throughput and the increased processing
capacity, Esquibel added.

  On the cellular side, Esquibel said carriers are adding
5G gear to the stadium, with AT&T having the most ex-

tensive deployment right now. Customers of AT&T and
Verizon will also be able to be switched over to the Wi-Fi
network when entering the park.

The  upgrades  to  its  wireless  infrastructure  also  set
the  stage  for  some  new  capabilities  coming  down  the
pike. The combo of Wi-Fi 6 and 5G services will help the
Dodgers deliver 4k and 8k video formats; it will also help
as professional sports move toward “probability gaming,”
i.e., online sports betting. Esquibel credits partners Cis-
co, AmpThink, Horizon Communications and MLB with
building  a  powerful  solution  to  enable  these  emerging
services and capabilities.

There were other elements to the Dodgers’ 2020 tech
stack refresh as well. Inside the stadium, they reworked
the  outfield  to  create  a  centerfield  plaza  with  left-  and
right-field pavilions, with cut-outs and walkways above
the  pavilions  plus  more  APs  than  last  year  to  accom-
modate  more  seated  and  standing  spectators.  Esquibel

said the team has also replaced its point-of-sale system,
and has added Appetize, a cloud-based POS concessions
app, as well as ParkHub to keep closer tabs on the Dodg-
ers’ parking lots.

  While the Wi-Fi 6 construction is complete, advance
testing and fine-tuning are on indefinite hold. Esquibel
and  his  Dodger  colleagues  are  sheltering  in  place  and
have been since mid-March. “The pandemic has slowed
down testing,” he said, nothing that the stadium needs
capacity  crowds  to  gauge  how  well  the  new  networks
are engineered and where antennas need adjusting. And
it’s clear that contemplating the first post-pandemic home
game brings out Esquibel’s fan boy, broadband wireless
notwithstanding.

“I want to smell the grass and be with the crowd,”
Esquibel  said.  “Like  everyone  else,  I  just  want  to  see
some baseball.” –STR–
