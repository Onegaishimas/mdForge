WHAT STADIUM TECH
MIGHT PROLIFERATE
IN 2023?

Looking back at 2022, it’s easy to proclaim it as a
banner year for stadium technology. Innovation on
multiple fronts arrived, not just as ideas but actual
products and services that brought immediate
improvement to stadium business areas like
concessions, ticketing, security and infrastructure.

Will 2023 bring more

acceleration of new
ideas and technology
deployments as venues continue
to try to solve existing pain points
as well as address newer ones,
like staffing concerns? Here is our
quick-take outlook on a number of
the topics we tracked last year and
will continue to do so going forward,
to help venue owners and operators
better understand what their peers
are doing and how that might inform
their own plans.

NO SLOWDOWN AHEAD SEEN FOR
CONCESSION TECHNOLOGY

The area of stadium operations
that saw the most visible growth
of new technology use had to be

concessions operations, with
multiple new ideas not just launched
but already building up a head of
steam as 2022 progressed.

One of the more revolutionary
ideas that caught on instantly with
both fans and operators was the
checkout-free concession stand,
where customers simply scanned a
credit card (or their palm) at entry,
went through the stores picking
out the items they wanted, and just
left, with billing taking place later
online. Though we haven’t yet seen
any detailed reports of revenue
generation, the general feedback
so far from venues and caterers is
that the stands can significantly

outperform traditional stands
in both revenue and speed of
transactions.

From August 2022 until January
2023 the number of stadium-based
checkout-free stands from the
two market leaders -- Zippin and
Amazon -- almost doubled, from 44
in late summer to 81 at our latest
count. Though we have heard some
pushback from stadium reps about
the upfront costs of the stores,
some recent additions to store
designs, including smaller, less
expensive stripped-down versions
of the stores, should convince more
venues to test the checkout-free
waters in 2023.

We also expect to see growth in
the simpler self-serve terminals
market, where leaders like
Mashgin and Toshiba are providing
devices that allow for much faster
concession transactions with fewer
live staff needed.

Mashgin, which has termimals that
use cameras to determine items
placed on its base, and Toshiba,
which has special-built units with
large scanning screens designed
to be faster and easier than similar
grocery-store devices, are winning
deployments based mainly on
flexibility and cost, as they can be
added to existing stands without
much reconfiguration.

Facial authentication technology
for even-faster payment and age
verification tasks is also making
concession-stand inroads,

especially at single-purpose
stands like the TendedBar stands.
We wouldn’t be surprised to see
Zippin add facial-authentication
technology as a payment and
verification choice going forward,
since it seems a good fit.

ADOPTION OF WALK-THROUGH
SECURITY SCANNERS SPEEDS UP

Walk-through security scanners,
a topic that we highlighted early
last year, saw its acceptance grow
during 2022 as big-name stadiums
adopted the technology that is
replacing the older metal-detector
devices. By allowing fans to walk
past scanning devices instead
of stopping, the devices can
significantly reduce the time fans
spend in venue-entry procedures,
one of the biggest pain points of the
game-day experience.

Evolv Technology got a big boost
when SoFi Stadium signed up
with the company as its security
provider, adding the venue to a list of
top NFL stadiums using Evolv that
grew throughout the year. The Evolv
Express systems, which were in
place for the full 2022 NFL season at
SoFi, joined deployments at Atlanta’s
Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Nissan
Stadium in Nashville, First Energy
Stadium in Cleveland, Acrisure
Stadium in Pittsburgh and Gillette
Stadium in Foxborough, Mass., among
other venues.

Xtract One, the company formally
known as Patriot One, signed a
formal deal with venue owner and

operator company Oak View Group
in 2022 to be a preferred security
systems provider. The deal netted
Xtract One some early venue wins,
including the new Moody Center at
the University of Texas in Austin and
at the new Acrisure Arena in Palm
Springs. CEIA, the longtime provider
of traditional metal detectors, was
also winning conversion deals for its
new walk-through OpenGate line.

LONG-THROW ANTENNAS ARE
ADDING MORE CUSTOMERS

Innovation on the wireless antenna
front for both cellular and Wi-Fi
networks jumped ahead in 2022
as well, with the lens antennas
from MatSing and Cisco’s new 9104
“Marlin” Wi-Fi antennas giving venue
network designers new options
to cover previously hard-to-reach
areas.

MatSing antennas, which now
seem to appear regularly in new
stadiums and retrofits, were used
to completely redo the cellular
coverage for the upper decks at
Acrisure Stadium, a deployment of
approximately 60 antennas. And the
new Cisco Wi-Fi antennas were key
to a top-down deployment at Geodis
Park, new home of the Nashville SC
MLS team (look for a profile later this
year in Stadium Tech Report).

The 9104 antennas were also used
in the Wi-Fi upgrade at State Farm
Stadium prior to this year’s Super
Bowl (see profile in this issue), and

have found homes in several arenas
we know of where they are being
added to bring Wi-Fi coverage to
stadium floor areas for concerts
and other events. UBS Arena is just
one of the venues known to have
installed the 9104s for this purpose.

FACIAL AUTHENTICATION THE
NEXT TO TAKE OFF?

Finally, 2022 also saw several live
deployments of facial authentication
technology used in several different
applications, including ticketing and
concessions purchases. At First
Energy Field in Cleveland, the NFL
Browns deployed Wicket’s facial
authentication technology for faster
ticket verification a tactic also used
by the New York Mets at Citi Field and
at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.

The Browns also experimented
with Wicket technology, along
with ID verification services
from IDmission, to support beer
purchases where age and payment
verification, were done by looking
at a screen. We expect to see
more uses of facial authentication
technology as 2023 unfolds.

WIRELESS UPGRADES
HAVE STATE FARM STADIUM
PREPARED FOR SUPER BOWL

\ \  BY PAUL KAPUSTKA

Eight years ago, the state-of-the

art networks inside the venue
now known as State Farm
Stadium set one-day records

for fan wireless data consumption at
Super Bowl XLIX. While the stadium
has remained one of the most active
large-event venues since then, the ever-
increasing demands of wireless users
meant that to properly host this year’s big
game, a full network rip-and-replace was
required.

STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   WINTER 2023    9

As it gets ready to host Super Bowl LVII
on Feb. 12, State Farm Stadium is once
again at the forefront of big-venue
network technology deployments, with
a brand-new Cisco Wi-Fi 6 network and
a completely upgraded digital cellular
DAS using gear from CommScope that
includes support for shared 5G services,
alongside separate 5G millimeter-wave
gear from all the leading carriers.

According to Mark Feller, vice president of technology
for the Arizona Cardinals, the complete network
overhaul was a 2-year project, completed while the
stadium hosted its usual slew of big events, including
NFL games, concerts and the Fiesta Bowl. And after
this year’s Super Bowl the stadium will host the NCAA
Men’s Final Four next year, in what Feller calls “the big
one-two” of big-time U.S. sporting events.

“The projects are very difficult, and it’s a long process
for us,” Feller said. And while he’s not sure if State Farm
Stadium will follow tradition
and set new high Wi-Fi and
DAS marks like Super Bowls
have historically done since
the then-University of the
Pacific Stadium did eight
years ago, he is confident
that the new network
infrastructure is more than
ready to handle whatever
demands the big games now
require.

OUT WITH THE OLD, IN WITH THE NEW

When it comes to the history of advanced wireless
networks inside large public venues, State Farm
Stadium holds a unique spot. While its first Super
Bowl, XLII in 2008, was before the current explosion of
mobile device usage (the first Apple iPhone had only
been available since June 2007), by the 2015 game the
stadium-networking revolution was in full motion.

With a new Cisco Wi-Fi network that included mostly
top-down and some handrail antenna deployments, the

stadium saw 6.23 TB of Wi-Fi
data used, the most seen to
that day. The celluar DAS from
third-party operator Crown
Castle, using CommScope
gear, brought improved
signals to areas both inside
and outside the venue, which
helped Verizon Wireless, AT&T
and Sprint to host a combined
total of 6.56 TB used in and

10    STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   WINTER 2023

STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   WINTER 2023    11

around the stadium. The combined total 12.79 TB was,
according to us at the time, “far and away the biggest
single day of wireless data use we’ve ever heard of.”

Now just eight years later, those totals seem like
numbers a big venue might see in the first hour after
fans’ arrival. At last year’s Super Bowl, SoFi Stadium
set the new high-water mark with 31.2 TB of Wi-Fi data
and 30.4 TB of cellular data on the Verizon and AT&T
networks.

To handle the new requirements of the NFL’s big game,
and of subsequent big events that will follow, State
Farm Stadium replaced its entire Wi-Fi network (along
with its core network components) with new Cisco gear,
including 300 of the new 9104 “Marlin” antennas, which
provide a longer, more focused connectivity beam.

According to Feller, the 9104s were part of a new
combination Wi-Fi design -- for the upper seating
deck, the 9104s were mounted overhead in the roof
infrastructure, an area that was too far away for
previous Wi-Fi antenna designs to work properly. In
the lower bowl, the stadium added approximately 600
under-seat enclosures for both Wi-Fi and DAS gear.

The underseat deployment, which Feller said was
started in 2021 and completed last year, was able to use
existing expansion seams to cut down on the number
of concrete core drills required. While underseat has
become a proven design, the farther-reach capabilities
of the newer Cisco gear is already winning rave reviews.

“Kudos to Cisco,” Feller said
about the new antennas.
“They perform really well.”

The upgrade to a full Wi-Fi 6 network should also
significantly improve overall connectivity, as more fan
devices are now in use that support the standard. Ohio
State’s Ohio Stadium, which installed a Wi-Fi 6 network
in 2019, recently reset the single-day Wi-Fi mark with a
34.8 TB event, where a majority of the traffic was fully
Wi-Fi 6 based.

GETTING READY FOR INCREASED 5G USAGE

Newer devices in fans’ hands could also make Super
Bowl LVII the first real “5G” big event, something the

carriers are prepared for with their own network
improvements. Like the Wi-Fi network, the old DAS was
fully replaced with new CommScope gear that supports
shared 5G signals in the midband “C” spectrum, as well
as all the 4G LTE spectrum ranges.

“The scale of 5G deployments in the new DAS is huge,”
said Upendra Pingle, senior vice president of intelligent
networks for CommScope. Pingle, like the carriers,
expects there to be a huge use of 5G services this year.
As such, the new fully digital network from CommScope
includes full 5G NR support in C-band spectrum for
Verizon and AT&T, and in band 41 (~2.5 GHz) for T-Mobile.

This year, the top carriers believe that the promise of 5G
services -- lower latency, faster speeds -- will become a
reality to more customers at the big
game. While 5G services have been
touted at Super Bowls for several
years now, the majority of devices
now in users’ hands can finally support
the technology, and it is showing up in
statistics. Add in the 5G support in the
new DAS -- which Pingle thinks may be
the largest stadium 5G network ever
built -- and the signs point toward a big
5G usage day.

Adam Schieber, vice president
for access construction and
engineering at AT&T, said the carrier
“saw an uptick” in overall 5G usage at
the recent Fiesta Bowl at State Farm
Stadium, which was a perfect “dry
run” for all the new networks in use.

“This could be the first time 5G
really takes off [at a big event],”

said Schieber. Desmond Jackbir, director of network
engineering at Verizon, said Verizon also expects to see
an increased level of 5G data use, and has designed its
new deployments to be ready.

“We saw more 5G than ever,
and more 5G than 4G near
the end of the [NFL] season,”
said Jackbir of the State Farm
Stadium network.

The cellular infrastructure also includes eight MatSing
Lens Antennas, whose long-range coverage abilities

added hundreds of antennas to support their different
spectrum bands, with placements in the upper
infrastructure as well as in small-cell deployments
outside the venue. T-Mobile said it has also added new
millimeter wave deployments, both inside and outside
the stadium.

According to representatives for both Verizon and AT&T,
their designs and deployment have also been a 2-year
project, a process similar for every Super Bowl these days.

And while Verizon customers will also have the ability to
have their devices auto-authenticate onto the stadium’s
Wi-Fi network, Jackbir said the carrier turned that
feature off during some late-season Cardinals games to
“stress test” Verizon’s cellular infrastructure.

“We were able to handle all our traffic on 4G and 5G, with
plenty of headroom,” Jackbir said. “While having our
own [Wi-Fi] SSID provides a comfort level, knowing we
could do it all on cellular helps us validate our design.”

“We started planning and preparing [for Phoenix] 2
years ago, and we’re already doing the same thing for
Las Vegas and New Orleans,” said Verizon’s Jackbir.
“We show up every year, and we know where the
challenges are.”

will provide service to the sidelines as
well as to the “Red Zone” seating area
at one end of the stadium. The new
DAS design, Upendra said, has 118
sectors and uses approximately 2,000
antennas, with about 1,000 of those
deployed underseat in the main bowl.

T-Mobile is also part of the stadium
DAS, adding coverage for its main 5G
spectrum band at 2.5 GHz to both the
inside and outside DAS deployments.
“The network upgrades we have made
to State Farm Stadium, Phoenix and
the surrounding cities will provide
our customers with a vastly improved
experience for years to come,” said
Neville Ray, President of Technology
at T-Mobile, in a prepared statement.

MOBILITIE BRINGS
NEW 5G DAS TO
CRYPTO.COM ARENA

Fans attending games and events at Crypto.com
Arena and L.A. Live now can count on solid 5G
cellular connectivity thanks to a new distributed
antenna deployment (DAS) from Mobilitie.

Replacing an older DAS design, the new deployment at possibly

one of the busiest basketball/hockey-sized arenas in the world
uses lens antennas from MatSing to provide top-down coverage
to most of the 20,000-capacity seating bowl. In addition to

participating on the DAS, all three major U.S. wireless carriers also have
their own millimeter-wave antenna deployments, ensuring 5G coverage
across a wide range of spectrum offerings.

STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   WINTER 2023    17

The deployment of the new network was not an easy one -- in addition to
having been started during the Covid pandemic, construction efforts also had
to work around live events being held on an almost nightly basis, according to
representatives from Mobilitie and the arena.

Arena upper infrastructure. Credit: Terry Sweeney, STR

But according to Mobilitie, the stadium and its
surrounding entertainment district now has a network
capable of supporting 5G NR (new radio) technologies
on the widest range of spectrum, including traditional
low-band and mid-band cellular channels as well as the
newer C-band and ultra-high bands, the latter used for
millimeter wave (mmWave).

With the venue network and the surrounding L.A. Live
part both nearly complete, Crypto.com Arena heads
into the remainder of its multi-phase renovation project
knowing that from here on in, cellular connectivity for
fans is a problem already solved.

TIME FOR NEW TECHNOLOGY ARRIVES WITH 5G

Formerly known as Staples Center, the arena at the
center of the L.A. Live district can most likely lay
claim to being the busiest pro sports venue, as it is
currently home to the NBA’s Los Angeles Lakers and
Los Angeles Clippers, as well as the NHL’s Los Angeles
Kings and the WNBA’s Los Angeles Sparks. Throw in a
regular mix of top concerts and “jewel” events like the
recent Grammys, and you have a stadium whose doors
basically never close.

updates and refreshes along the way can help keep
pace with the always-increasing demands for wireless
connectivity, at some point there is no evading the
generational rip and replace.

Lee Zeidman, president of Crypto.com Arena, Microsoft
Theater and L.A. Live, said the natural “end of life” of
the previous network brought about talks on what a
new network would look like -- and who would help
provide it. Executives from the global partnerships
group of stadium owner AEG Worldwide, Zeidman said,
knew Mobilitie from its previous DAS work at Dignity
Health Sports Park, another AEG facility. Zeidman said
discussions both internally and with Mobilitie on a new
cellular network began prior to and then through the
start of the Covid pandemic.

BUILDING THE FLYING AIRPLANE

If there’s an overused stadium renovation analogy, it’s
the theme of “trying to build an airplane while it’s flying.”
But in this case, putting a new network into Crypto.com
Arena was more like building a flying plane that was
simultaneously hosting an ice show, a concert and a
women’s hoops game during the construction.

As such, the building known now as Crypto.com Arena
has always had good connectivity networks. While

It’s a scene that will be repeated over the next few
years, as the stadium undergoes a “nine-figure”

18    STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   WINTER 2023

STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   WINTER 2023    19

for most of the new equipment, a capacity situation
there meant that temporary gear had to fit somewhere
else while the existing infrastructure elements were
swapped out.

The solution, Witherspoon said, was a MatSing antenna
placement on a permament wall that sits at one end
of the stadium. As equipment was replaced, he said,
different carrier signals were routed through the
temporary antenna, which backfilled the coverage in
the bowl seating areas. Once the dust settled on the
new construction and the carriers were on-air, the
temporary solution was then decommissioned. Lighter
remote gear from DAS infrastructure supplier Solid
also helped with the new design, reducing the weight
needed on the upper-infrastructure installs.

“It was a challenge, but we
had a great team between
us and the venue people we
worked with,” Witherspoon
said.

MORE THAN DOUBLE THE DENSITY

In the end, Crypto.com Arena now has a cellular
network inside the building that is more than double
the density of its previous one, going from 9 sectors to
24. Outside the building, an 8-sector ODAS will cover
outdoor events as well as foot traffic in the reimagined
L.A. Live space, where one street will be changed into a
pedestrian plaza, among other enhancements.

renovation that includes “new LED screens and
ribbon boards, upgrades to the concourse levels and
improvements to in-arena dining as well as a ‘refresh’
of the locker rooms for the Lakers, Kings and Sparks,”
according to the arena.

For the first phase, which included the network
overhaul, Zeidman said the stadium had a window of 131
days for completion -- all while at the same time hosting
45 events such as concerts, family shows and the Los
Angeles Sparks home games.

“The biggest challenge is,
each summer we do not
know when we can start [any
renovations] due to playoffs
but we must be ready each
Oct. 1 due to the start of the
NBA/NHL seasons,” said
Zeidman.

Jammie Witherspoon, senior director of technical
solutions for Mobilitie, said the trick during deployment
was how to keep as much of the network running as
possible while replacement gear was being installed.

The technical direction for the new network, which
Zeidman said was an overhead design using MatSing
lens antennas chosen by AEG’s global technology
division, did provide some help in Mobilitie’s decision to
deploy a temporary DAS network that would overlay the
original one during construction. While the building’s
upper catwalk infrastucture would be the final location

“Mobilitie has been a great
partner and we look forward
to the completion of the
entire L.A. Live campus,”
Zeidman said.

Once fully completed, Zeidman said the new DAS
“will give us one of the fastest, most technologically
advanced multi-carrier wireless networks in the
country, which will improve our venue operations and
enhance our fan experiences.”

ACRISURE ARENA
BRINGS HOCKEY,
BIG CONCERTS TO
THE DESERT

\ \  BY TERRY SWEENEY

It’s almost the stuff of fever dreams: 28 feet below the sunbaked surface of

the southern California desert sits an ice rink that’s home to a professional
hockey team. And on at least one Sunday in late January, the arena looked
darn near close to capacity.

This dusty corner of the Sonoran desert may not look like the most auspicious
place to spend almost $500 million on an 11,000-seat arena. But sports venue
developer and manager Oak View Group made that bet and in June 2021 broke
ground on Acrisure Arena, 12 miles east of Palm Springs.

As if the combined size and remote location of the venue weren’t enough of
a challenge, there’s also the reality that the region is better known for golf
and tennis. But OVG was looking to find a home and practice facility for its
American Hockey League team, the Coachella Valley Firebirds, the minor league

walk-through security scanners speed up the entry procedure.

Joyce Szudzik, vice president of marketing for Acrisure
Arena, said the venue is the right scale for this location,
when you consider what else is available in the region
for sports and entertainment. McCallum Theatre in
nearby Palm Desert has only about 1,200 seats. The “big
rooms” of local Native American-owned casinos top out
at around 3,500 people. The region has been ripe for a
medium-sized facility for some time, Szudzik explained.

OVG also isn’t relying solely on hockey to fill seats at
Acrisure. Dave Chappelle and Chris Rock headlined
the facility’s grand opening in mid-December 2022.
Musical acts on the Acrisure schedule like Shania Twain,
Jimmy Buffet and Harry Styles each draw different
demographics. And the arena was built with that kind
of adaptability in mind. The seats under the main video
board retract, a stage goes up, and the hockey rink
transforms into a concert hall relatively quickly.

counterpart to the National Hockey League’s Seattle
Kraken, which OVG also partially owns.

OVG’s desert bet starts to make more sense when you
consider that the Coachella Valley, better known for
its eponymous music festival, isn’t the collection of
quiet little desert towns it was 20 years ago. The region
between Palm Springs and Indio has been filling in
steadily, now counting more than 400,000 residents.

ACRISURE’S TECHNOLOGY MEASURES UP

OVG owns and operates several sports and
entertainments venues around the country, and
recognized that robust, seamless technology is
a baseline customer expectation at facilities like
Acrisure.

The close-in roof provides
space to mount all kinds of
connectivity gear

Verizon handled the technical design and initial
management of the IT infrastructure at the new area,
said Phil Montford, senior manager of technology for
Acrisure Arena. The backbone network is 10-Gigabit
Ethernet with redundant dual connections, with
switches made by Extreme Networks. This backbone
handles all the data, cellular and video needs of the
venue, and connects to Acrisure’s two Internet service
providers, Spectrum and Frontier.

Two Wi-Fi networks are also in operation; a public SSID
for fans, the other for back-of-the-house corporate
use. There are 346 Wi-Fi access points across the
property, Montford said, also Extreme gear.

Acrisure’s APs are mounted overhead, which Montford
views as a benefit that limits exposure to interference.
“When you have a bowl like this with its concave shape
made of concrete, radio waves tend to bounce around,”
he said. “We haven’t had to do much [Wi-Fi] tuning…
only a little bit for the first two games.”

Wi-Fi supports other Acrisure requirements like the
Xtract One SmartGateways, used at all the arena’s
entrances for security screening. With no pocket
emptying or shoe removal required, the system is
allegedly able to distinguish between a smartphone and
a weapon, even a plastic one. The system also makes
arena entry six times faster for patrons and reduces
staffing costs by 50 percent, according to Szudzik.

Concessions are making limited use of Wi-Fi. Patrons
in the arena’s suites can order from a QR code menu.
Acrisure’s long term goal is that seats in the premium
bowl areas will have QR codes attached to them for
in-seat ordering and service, but that capability is not

currently activated, said Pablo Villareal, the arena’s
director of premium.

Acrisure’s cellular distributed antenna system (DAS)
sports eight zones and 146 antennas; it’s currently
occupied only by Verizon, though AT&T is expected to
join sometime this year.

CONNECTIVITY GOOD FOR FANS AND BACK OF HOUSE

Speed tests of fan-facing Wi-Fi and DAS inside Acrisure
showed adequate performance for most attendees. Best
overall performance for the Wi-Fi was in Section 127
closest to the concourse entry level of the bowl at 54.43
Mbps upload/50.36 Mbps download; Wi-Fi was slowest in
our test in Section 103 at 19.19 Mbps/13.82 Mbps.

Verizon’s DAS proved faster on download speeds and
pokier on the upload; best performance was near the
top of Section 115 with 81.18 Mbps/16.37 Mbps. Speeds
were slowest in our test halfway down in Section 118 at
21.82 Mbps/1.7 Mbps.

Average speeds in our Acrisure tests for Firebirds_
Fan_Wi-Fi was 26.71 Mbps/46.43 Mbps; Verizon’s DAS
averaged 55.1 Mbps/7.93 Mbps overall.

The Firebirds’ video requirements of the IT
infrastructure aren’t inconsequential. Montford and
his team ensure there’s a video feed for broadcasting
games on AHL-TV; the local ABC affiliate, KESQ, is
broadcasting 10 Firebirds’ game this season and
draws from the feed. And there’s an in-house radio
communication for AHL officials; IP cameras point
down over each goal, connected to a server, and an
iPad, Montford explained.

“There’s also ViPr cam, which produces a 4K ultra-
wide video feed of the entire ice throughout the game
and goes straight to the AHL only, for play reviews,” he
added. A network-attached storage (NAS) system is
used for instant replay; a separate NAS is devoted to
inhouse video controls.

Montford is also quick to credit his IT counterparts
at other company-owned sporting venues. “OVG has
opened five other new arenas in the last 14 months,”
he said, noting that his colleagues at these other
venues generously shared their knowledge with him.
“It’s a pleasure anytime you have a blank slate like this,”
Montford said.

Acrisure Arena is also aiming to be more carbon-neutral
by 2025, taking advantage of all that sunshine with
solar energy panels over most of the parking areas. The
entire building will be able to operate on a non-game
day using 100 percent solar, and 70 percent on a game
day, Szudzik noted. “The venue has been thoughtfully
designed in a number of ways, by people with years
of experience, who understand how things work,” she
added.

In a partnership with sponsor Verizon, in August and September of this year we reached out to the Stadium
Tech Report audience and asked them to participate in our second Stadium Connectivity Outlook survey,
which asked a wide range of questions about the current state of a venue’s connectivity, and where the
venues, teams and schools would prioritize investments and strategies. Their answers are now available for
you to read, in both a survey results format and an accompanying white paper that summarizes the data.
