COMING YOUR WAY:
MORE RESEARCH,
MORE ANALYSIS

BY PAUL KAPUSTKA

T wenty-four terabytes of Wi-Fi data at the

Super Bowl, another 31 TB during Final
Four  weekend.  When  it  comes  to  the
demands placed on large public-venue
wireless  networks  these  days,  there  is
apparently no top end yet in sight. And
just to make the game harder, everything an IT profes-
sional knows about stadium networks is on the cusp of
huge  change.  With  Wi-Fi  6,  5G  and  CBRS  on  the  near
horizon, how do you figure out what’s the best next step
to take?

  While we here at Mobile Sports Report can’t design
your  network  for  you,  what  we  can  do  is  try  to  offer
some more help when it comes to separating reality from
hype.  Starting  with  this  issue  of  our  Stadium  Tech  Re-

port series, MSR is going to add in more forward-looking
research  and  analysis  of  technical  and  business  topics
confronting  the  stadium  networking  marketplace.  Our
first effort is a white paper/PowerPoint dive into the key
components  of  the  new  802.11ax  Wi-Fi  standard,  also
known as Wi-Fi 6, with a clear focus on what it means
specifically for large public-venue networks. And there’s
more on the way.

In  the  past,  MSR’s  Stadium  Tech  Report  series  has
focused  mainly  on  providing  profiles  of  successful  (or
not successful) stadium network and technology deploy-
ments, under the thinking that says the best way to learn

STADIUM TECH REPORT    SUMMER 2019     5

about how to bring more forward-looking expertise on
topics like Wi-Fi 6 to the MSR reader audience.

  While the meat of this report is based on a Wi-Fi 6
presentation  and  essay  developed  by  AmpThink,  MSR
helped clarify the material to make it fit into our report
format,  with  the  idea  that  this  report  would  be  just  a
starting point for deeper discussions into each of the rel-
evant features that we think make Wi-Fi 6 a compelling
technology for venues to consider.

  Going  forward  this  summer  and  fall,  you  can  look
for MSR to explore each of the Wi-Fi 6 features in more
detail,  with  either  short  essays,  podcasts  or  additional
methods, with plans to add in voices outside of just MSR
and AmpThink. Again, the idea is not just to promote a
single person or company’s viewpoint, but to provide in-
formation examined and vetted by as many knowledge-
able people as possible. And that’s where you come in.

  Having  attended  conferences  like  SEAT  (Daytona
will be my seventh time!) I know how many smart peo-
ple there are out there in the stadium networking tech-
nology professional world, and now it’s time for as many
of you as possible to participate in this process. Ideally,
such reports like the Wi-Fi 6 one we’re running in this
issue  would  be  run  past  as  wide  a  group  of  potential
users as possible beforehand, to help refine and clarify
the most pertinent parts and to fill in the gaps that might
have been missed. While I’m confident most readers will
find great value in the vendor-agnostic material provided
by  AmpThink  and  MSR,  I  also  think  having  more  par-
ticipants going forward will make for an even stronger
team.  If  you  want  to  join  in  the  fun,  let  me  know  via
email at kaps at mobilesportsreport.com, or find me at
SEAT and we can discuss this plan over a cold beverage.
Cheers! –MSR–

about  something  is  from  someone  who’s  already  done
it.  According  to  many  of  the  readers  who  contact  me
about our publications, these profiles are the most pop-
ular thing we do and by no means will we be letting up
in this area. In fact, we’d like to increase the number of
profiles we do, so rest assured our stories about network,
display and other stadium technology deployments will
continue apace.

AN INCREDIBLE INFLECTION POINT

That being said, in the middle of 2019 the industry
finds  itself  at  an  incredible  inflection  point,  with  many
possible paths to choose when it comes to near-future
technology  and  business  strategies.  With  Wi-Fi  6  gear
already  arriving  in  the  market  and  CBRS  close  behind
– and 5G cellular not far behind that – venue operators
and owners, teams, schools and all other associated us-
ers of venue technology are going to be called upon to
pick  winners  without  much  in  the  way  of  established
history. And that’s just on the technology side of things.

Changes  are  also  imminent  to  the  business  models
behind  stadium  wireless  networks,  from  how  things
like distributed antenna systems (DAS) are funded, and
whether or not the current models will still be viable as
carriers  move  to  the  multiple-spectrum  versions  of  5G.
Will the third-party neutral host model of network build-
ing hold up going forward, or will more teams and ven-
ues need to take on more responsibilities – and how will
the carriers play in a Wi-Fi 6 world? As always we will try
to report on the early movers in all the technology and
business categories, but it also seems to make sense to
provide as much forward-looking information as we can,
to  help  stadium  network  professionals  make  the  best
choices for their businesses as well as for their fans.

  What you won’t see from us is any meaningless drift
into  “market  size”  predictions,  the  kind  of  “research”
that is absolutely worthless to people who have to make
technical and business-case decisions. We’re also not go-
ing to be in the business of rubber-stamping vendor-spe-
cific takes, because the last thing this industry needs is
another outlet for pay-to-play content.

O ur goal is hard, but simple: We want

to  build  a  base  of  material  from
subject-matter experts and end-user
implementers in a way that mirrors
the  methods  we  use  to  write  our
profiles – in an editorially objective
way, and if possible with peer review from multiple con-
tributors and partners. The Wi-Fi 6 report encapsulated in
this report is a joint effort between MSR and our friends
at AmpThink, something that grew out of conversations

TEMPORARY NETWORK
FOR FINAL FOUR PART OF

WI-FI RECORD AT
U.S. BANK
STADIUMBY PAUL KAPUSTKA

FINAL FOUR WIFI AT
U.S. BANK STADIUM

FOUR TEAMS
TWO DAYS

31.2TERABYTES
O ne of the traditional characteristics of the Final Four is

the yearly travel scramble of the fortunate fans and teams who have advanced to
the championship weekend. Somehow, with only a week’s notice, plane flights,
road trips and hotel rooms get scheduled and booked, leading to packed houses
at college basketball’s biggest event.

  On the stadium technology side, a similar last-minute fire drill happens just about every year as well, as the
hosting  venues  reconfigure  themselves  to  host  basketball  games  inside  cavernous  buildings  built  mainly  to  hold
football crowds. At this year’s NCAA Men’s Final Four at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, the stadium tech team
and partner AmpThink were able to quickly construct a temporary Wi-Fi network to cover the additional lower-bowl
seating. The new capactity was part of a record-setting Wi-Fi network performance at the venue, with single-day
numbers surpassing those from Super Bowl 52, held in the same building the year before.

The Wi-Fi numbers, both staggering and sobering especially to venues who are next in line for such bucket-list
events, totaled 31.2 terabytes for the two days of game action, according to figures provided by the NCAA. For the
semifinal games on Saturday April 6, U.S. Bank Stadium’s Wi-Fi network saw 17.8 TB of traffic, topping the 16.31 TB
used during Super Bowl 52 on Feb. 4, 2018. The Saturday semifinals also set an attendance record for the venue,
with 72,711 on hand, topping the 67,612 in attendance for Super Bowl 52.

     During Monday’s championship game, U.S. Bank Stadium saw an additional 13.4
TB of data used on the Wi-Fi network, giving the venue three of the top four single-
day Wi-Fi numbers we’ve reported, with this year’s mark of 24.05 TB at Super Bowl
53  in  Atlanta  the  only  bigger  number.  Saturday’s  take  rate  at  U.S.  Bank  Stadium,

to the courtside areas for media internet and TV monitor
connections.  Like  it  does  for  every  venue  network  it
designs  and  deploys,  AmpThink  came  to  the  stadium
equipped  with  a  wide  assortment  of  lengths  of  pre-
terminated  cables,  preparation  that  made  the  fast
deployment possible.

“If we had to spin raw cable and terminate it on site,
we never would have been able to finish in five days,”
said AmpThink president Bill Anderson.

AmpThink’s previous experience in deploying such
temporary networks under temporary seating – including

however,  surpassed  even  the  most-recent  Super  Bowl,
with 51,227 unique users on the network, a 70 percent
take rate.

‘LIKE BUILDING AN ARENA NETWORK INSIDE A
FOOTBALL STADIUM’

There’s  no  doubt  that  the  temporary  network
installed  by  AmpThink  and  the  U.S.  Bank  Stadium  IT
team  contributed  a  great  deal  to  the  final  Wi-Fi  totals,
with 250 access points installed in the additional seats.
Like  at  other  football  venues  that  are  transformed  into
basketball  arenas,  U.S.  Bank  Stadium  had  temporary
seating  installed  on  all  four  sides  of  the  stadium,  with
temporary  risers  stretching  down  over  football  seating
as  well  as  with  risers  built  behind  both  baskets.  More
seats were installed on the “floor” of the football field,
right  up  to  the  elevated  court  set  in  the  middle.  The
temporary APs, like the existing ones in the stadium, are
from Cisco.

“There are a lot more moving parts to a Final Four
than to a Super Bowl,” said David Kingsbury, director of
IT  for  U.S.  Bank  Stadium,  describing  the  difference  in
providing  the  networking  and  technical  underpinnings
for  each  event.  While  planning  for  the  networks  was
obviously done far in advance, the actual buildout of the
temporary Wi-Fi couldn’t even begin until the additional
seating was in place, a task that finished just five days
before the first game was played.

That’s when AmpThink deployed a staff of 12 workers
to start connecting cables to APs and to switches, while
also adding in another 700 wired network connections

at the previous year’s Final Four in San Antonio – taught
the  company  that  it  would  also  need  protection  for
under-seat switch deployments, to fend off the inevitable
liquid spills from the seats above. That requirement was
potentially even more necessary at U.S. Bank Stadium,
since this year’s Final Four was the first to allow in-venue
sales of alcoholic beverages.

  With  some  of  the  temporary  seating  installed  over
existing  seating,  there  were  95  APs  in  the  existing
handrail-enclosure design that had to be turned off for
the  Final  Four,  according  to  Kingsbury.  The  250  new
APs added were all installed under the folding chairs, in
enclosures that simply sat on the floor.

According  to  AmpThink’s  Anderson,  the  company
did  learn  a  lesson  at  U.S.  Bank  Stadium  –  that  it  will,
at  future  events,  need  to  secure  the  actual  enclosures
since  during  the  weekend  curious  fans  opened  a  few

12        STADIUM TECH REPORT   SUMMER 2019

In San Antonio, AmpThink had zip-tied the enclosures
to  chairs,  which  led  to  increased  labor  to  detatch  the
devices during the post-event breakdown. While having
no such measures at U.S. Bank led to a fast removal –
AmpThink said it had removed all the temporary network
elements just seven hours after the championship game
confetti had settled – for next year’s Final Four AmpThink
plans to at least zip-tie the enclosures shut so that fans
can’t attempt any ad hoc network administration.

MORE APS FOR BACK OF HOUSE OPERATIONS

Another difference between the Final Four and the
Super Bowl is the fact that four, not two, teams are in
attendance for a full weekend, necessitating the need to
set up temporary “work rooms” adjacent to each school’s
locker room area. The media work center for the Final
Four is also typically larger than that of a Super Bowl,
again with more cities and their attendant media outlets
on  site  thanks  to  there  being  four,  not  just  two,  teams
involved.

“We  had  to  cover  a  lot  of  places  in  the  stadium
that we don’t normally cover” with wireless and wired
network access, Kingsbury said, saying that an additional
30 APs were needed for team rooms and the main media
workspace, which were located on the field level of the
stadium in the back hallways. An interesting note at U.S.
Bank  Stadium  was  that  the  yards  and  yards  of  fabric
used as curtains to cover the clear-plastic ETFE roofing
and wall areas was actually benefical to Wi-Fi operations,
since it cut off some of the reflective interference caused
by the transparent surfaces.

According  to  Kingsbury  the  final  count  of  active
APs for the Final Four was 1,414, a number reached by
adding in the temporary APs while deducting the ones
taken offline. Not included in the official NCAA traffic
numbers was an additional 3 TB of traffic seen during
the  free-admission  Friday  practice  sessions,  when
36,000 fans visited the stadium, with 9,000 joining the
Wi-Fi network.

From  the  official  stats,  the  peak  concurrent  user
number from Final Four Saturday of 31,141 was also an

overall record, beating Super Bowl 53’s mark of 30,605.
(Super Bowl 53 had 70,081 fans in attendance for the Feb.
3 game between the New England Patriots and the Los
Angeles  Rams.)  The  Wi-Fi  network  numbers  for  Mon-
day’s  championship  game  (won  by  Virginia  85-77  over
Texas Tech in overtime) saw big numbers itself, with 13.4
TB  of  total  data  used,  and  48,449  unique  connections
and 29,487 peak concurrent users (out of 72,062 in atten-
dance). Monday’s game also produced a peak through-
put number of 11.2 Gbps just after the game ended.

  None  of  those  totals  could  have  been  reached
without  the  temporary  network,  which  AmpThink’s
Anderson  compared  to  “building  a  10,000-seat  arena
network inside a football stadium.” Next stop for a similar
temporary Wi-Fi network is Mercedes-Benz Stadium in
Atlanta, where the 2020 Final Four awaits. –MSR–

WI-FI TO THE NEW
19,400-SEAT HOME
ARENA FOR THE
MINNESOTA UNITED
FC MLS TEAM.

T he  striking  new  $250  million  fa-

cility, opened in April just off the
highway  that  connects  Minneap-
olis  to  St.  Paul,  is  a  looker  from
first sight, especially at night if the
multi-colored  lights  in  its  cursive
outside  shell  are  lit.  Inside,  the
clean sight lines and close-to-the-
pitch  seating  that  seems  a  hallmark  of  every  new  soc-
cer-specific facility are accompanied by something that’s
not as easy to detect: A solid fan-facing Wi-Fi network
with approximately 480 Cisco access points, in a profes-
sional deployment that wouldn’t seem out of place at any
larger facility, like an NFL stadium.

Actually,  the  Wi-Fi  network  inside  Allianz  Field  is
somewhat  more  conspicuous  than  many  other  deploy-
ments, mainly because instead of hiding or camouflag-
ing the APs, most have very visible branding, letting vis-
itors know that the Wi-Fi is “powered by” Atomic Data.

  Who is Atomic Data? Though perhaps better known
for their data center and enterprise business managed-ser-
vices  prowess,  the  215-person  Minneapolis-based  firm
also has a developing track record in stadium technology
deployments, including a role as part of the IT support
team for the launch of U.S. Bank Stadium two years ago.
In  what  is  undeniably  a  unique  arrangement,  Atomic
Data  paid  for  and  owns  the  network  infrastructure  at
Allianz Field, providing fan-facing Wi-Fi as well as back-
of-house connectivity as a managed service to the team
as well as to internal venue vendors like concessionaires.

WHILE A ROBUST WI-FI NETWORK WAS NOT PART OF THE
ORIGINAL PLAN, ATOMIC DATA AND THE TEAM FOUND A WAY TO
MAKE A MORE DIGITAL-FOCUSED FAN EXPERIENCE HAPPEN.

LOCAL PARTNER EARNS TEAM’S TRUST
  While most new stadium builds often look for net-
work and technology firms with a bigger name or longer
history, Atomic Data was well known to the Minnesota
team, having been a sponsor even before the club moved
up to MLS. Chris Wright, CEO of the MNUFC, credited
a longtime relationship with Atomic CEO Jim Wolford, a
company Wright had known from his days with the NBA
Timberwolves and WNBA’s Lynx.

“They [Atomic Data] are a very strong local company
and we knew of their work, including at U.S. Bank Stadi-
um,” Wright said. “Jim has also been a huge advocate of
the [soccer] club, even before they moved to MLS. Their
history is solid, and they [Atomic Data] have an incredi-
ble reputation.”

As  the  team  prepared  to  move  into  its  under-con-
struction  home,  Wright  said  that  originally  having  a
high-definition wireless network wasn’t in the cards.

“The  original  plan  was  not  to  have  a  robust  Wi-Fi
network,” Wright said, citing overall budget concerns as
part of the issue. But when he was brought in as CEO he
was looking for a way to change the direction and have
a more digital-focused fan experience – and he said by
increasing Atomic Data’s partnership, the company and
the team found a way to make it happen.

18        STADIUM TECH REPORT   SUMMER 2019

As described by both Wright and Atomic Data, the
deal includes having Atomic Data pay for and own the
Wi-Fi network components, and also to act as the com-
plete  IT  outsourcer  for  the  team,  providing  wired  and
wireless connectivity as a managed service.

“When  you  look  at  the  demographic  of  our  fans,
they’re mostly millenials and we wanted to have robust
connectivity to connect with them,” Wright said. “Over
time we were able to negotiate a deal [with Atomic Data]
to build what I think is the most capable Wi-Fi network
ever  for  a  soccer-specific  venue.  I  think  we’ve  turned
some heads.”

UNDER SEAT AND OUTSIDE THE DOORS

Just before the stadium hosted its first league game,
Mobile Sports Report got a tour of the facility from Yagya
Mahadevan, enterprise project manager for Atomic Data
and sort of the live-in maestro for the network at Allianz
Field. Mahadevan, who worked on the U.S. Bank Stadi-
um network deployment before joining Atomic Data full-
time,  was  clearly  proud  of  the  company’s  deployment
work, which fit in well with the sleek designs of the new
facility.

For  the  250  APs  in  the  main  seating  bowl,  Atom-
ic  Data  used  a  good  amount  of  under-seat  AP  deploy-
ments, since many of the seats have no overhang. A mix

of  overhead  APs  covers  the  seating  areas  that  do  have
structures overhead, and more APs – which are clearly
noticable, including some APs painted white to pop out
against black walls and vice versa – are mounted along
concourse  walkways  as  well  as  on  the  outside  of  the
main entry gates. Since MNUFC is a paperless ticketing
facility, Mahadevan said Atomic Data paid special atten-
tion to entry gates to make sure fans could connect to
Wi-Fi to access their digital tickets.

  Wright, who called Atomic Data’s devotion to service
“second to none,” noted that before the first three games
at the new stadium, Atomic Data had staff positioned in
a ring around the outside of the field, making sure fans
knew how to access their tickets via the team app and
the Wi-Fi network.

“The lines to get in were really minimized, and that
level of desire to deliver a high-end experience is just the
way they think,” Wright said of Atomic Data.

According to Atomic Data the network is backed by
two  redundant  10-Gbps  backbone  pipes  (from  Centu-
ryLink and Consolidated Communications) and is set up
to  also  provide  secure  Wi-Fi  connectivity  to  the  wide
number of independent retail and concession partners.
Mahadevan also said that the network has a number of
redundant cable drops already built in, in case more APs
need to be added in the future. The stadium also has a
20        STADIUM TECH REPORT   SUMMER 2019

cellular distributed antenna system (DAS) built by Mobil-
itie, but as of early this spring none of the carriers had
yet been able to deploy gear.

E ven  the  chilly  temperatures  at

the  team’s  April  13  home  opener
didn’t  keep  fans  from  trying  out
the new network, as Atomic Data
said  it  saw  85  gigabytes  of  Wi-
Fi  data  used  that  day,  with  6,968
unique Wi-Fi device connections,
a  35  percent  take  rate  from  the
sellout  19,796  fans  on  hand.  According  to  the  Atomic
Data figures, the stadium’s Wi-Fi network saw peak Wi-
Fi bandwidth usage of 1.9 Gbps on that opening day; of
the 85 GB Wi-Fi data total, download traffic was 38.7 GB
and upload traffic was 46.3 GB.

According  to  Wright,  the  stadium  has  already  had
several visits from representatives from other clubs, who
are all interested in the networking technology. Wright’s
advice to other clubs who are in the process of thinking
about or building new stadiums: You should get on the
horn with Atomic Data.

“I tell them if you’re from Austin or New England, you
should be talking to Atomic,” Wright said. “They should try
to replicate the relationship we have with them.” –MSR–

ANALYSIS

WI-FI 6

THE GENERATIONAL LEAP IN TECHNOLOGY
NEEDED TO KEEP PACE WITH DEMAND

For IT professionals who run Wi-Fi networks inside large public venues,
there is both excitement and fear when the latest data traffic numbers are
reported from the biggest sporting events. The excitement comes in part
from seeing the ever-increasing totals of data used at bucket-list events
like the Super Bowl, as they stretch the boundaries of network performance.
The fear kicks in when you start wondering whether the networks –
including your own – have run out of room to grow.

  Over the past 8 years, traffic consumption at the Super
Bowl  has  grown  from  300  gigabytes  to  24  terabytes,  a
staggering 87% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”).
If consumption continues to grow at the same rate, we
can predict that demand at next year’s Super Bowl will
exceed 40 TB.

  Over the same period, there have been incremental
gains  in  technology  that  have  enabled  the  growth  in
consumption. The migration of devices from 2.4 GHz to 5

GHz (802.11b to 802.11a) allowed access to new spectrum.
Improvements  in  modulation  techniques  and  chipset
capabilities  (802.11g  to  802.11n  to  802.11ac)  improved
effective data rates. Antennas specifically developed for
high density deployments were introduced, reducing cell
sizes thereby increasing channel re-use. Combined with
year  over  year  refinement  of  deployment  techniques,
stadium Wi-Fi capacity has successfully grown to meet
the increasing demand.

24        STADIUM TECH REPORT   SUMMER 2019

ANALYSIS

But  operators  of  the  networks  at  both  Mercedes-
Benz Stadium and U.S. Bank Network will tell you that
at  big  events  like  the  Super  Bowl  and  the  Final  Four,
their  Wi-Fi  systems  are  now  spectrally  constrained  –
meaning,  that  they  are  already  using  all  the  available
depth of unlicensed spectrum to service the fans’ data
demands. Such signs seem to indicate that without the
release of new spectrum or another generational leap in
technology, current Wi-Fi technology will be insufficient
to meet growing demand.

Fortunately for the stadium Wi-Fi community, there
is an answer: The new 802.11ax standard, which is now
known by the new marketing title of “Wi-Fi 6.” Wi-Fi 6 is
the generational leap in technology that will enable Wi-
Fi systems to keep pace with demand. Coupled with the
potential expansion of the available unlicensed spectrum
incorporating  significant  portions  of  the  spectrum
between 5.8 GHz and 7 GHz, Wi-Fi 6 has the potential to
realize a wirelessly connected venue without constraints.

  With a wide range of technical improvements, Wi-Fi
6 will greatly advance the entire Wi-Fi ecosystem, for all
types of uses. But for venue networks the new features
are especially important, since Wi-Fi 6 will allow network
operators to significantly improve each of the three main
things  that  matter  when  it  comes  to  in-venue  network
performance:  it  will  increase  the  amount  of  available
spectrum  and  number  of  channels;  it  will  increase  the
average  data  rate  for  clients;  and  it  will  increase  the
ability  to  re-use  channels  in  your  space.  Let’s  explore
some of those features in detail.

HOW WI-FI 6 ADDRESSES CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS
  Wi-Fi  6  directly  addresses  the  capacity  constraints
inherent in the prior Wi-Fi standards in 5 key areas:
•  Migration from OFDM to OFDMA
•  The addition of BSS Coloring
•  The introduction of 1024 QAM modulation
•  The expansion of 4x4 multi-user, multiple input,
  multiple output (MU-MIMO) to 8x8 MU-MIMO
•  The incorporation of Target Wake Times

STADIUM TECH REPORT    SUMMER 2019     25

ANALYSIS

OFDMA

The most important addition to the Wi-Fi 6 standard is
orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA).
Wi-Fi  5  relied  on  orthogonal  frequency  division
multiplexing (OFDM) which only allowed a single device
to  communicate  on  a  given  channel  at  a  given  time.
OFDMA,  however,  allows  for  concurrent  conversations
to traverse the same airwaves by segmenting a channel
into sub-channels.

The  scheduler  is  described  in  the  802.11ax  standard.
However,  the  implementation  of  a  scheduler  is  left  up
to the manufacturer. The scheduler is the manufacturer’s
secret sauce.

For  venue  networks,  the  bottom  line  on  OFDMA
is  huge:  It  allows  Wi-Fi  6  networks  to  accomodate
more clients and more traffic over the same amount of
spectrum.

  Why  is  this  better?  To  use  a  simple  traffic  analogy,
OFDMA  turns  what  used  to  be  a  single  lane  of  traffic
that is as slow as the car in front of you (OFDM) into a
multi-lane  highway,  where  any  car  can  pass  the  traffic
and more cars can use the same road at the same time.

Sub-channels  allow  for  the  integration  of  a  scheduler.
The scheduler’s job is to efficiently pack data to or from
multiple  end  devices  into  a  single  combined  channel.

BSS COLORING

A  key  limitation  of  Wi-Fi  5  is  the  multiple  access
mechanism.  The  assumption  is  that  when  two  devices
communicate  concurrently  on  the  same  channel,  the
result  is  a  collision  and  the  outcome  of  a  collision  is
data corruption. In stadium bowls this situation can be
problematic, since even with good design and interference
plans, it’s often still possible for client devices to “hear”
APs across the bowl instead of the one they are closest

26        STADIUM TECH REPORT   SUMMER 2019

ANALYSIS

to. Even if it’s a non-optimal link, when a device hears
communications ont he channel it’s using, under Wi-Fi 5
it has to wait for that communication to be over before it
can transmit.

  With Wi-Fi 6 and BSS Coloring, such spatial re-use
issues are directly addressed. When packets are “colored,”
devices  that  are  not  participating  in  the  conversation
can  transmit  and  will  transmit  using  their  own  color
to  differentiate  their  communications  from  neighbor
conversations. By allowing two separate conversations to
occur on the same channel between discrete end point
pairs,  each  channel  may  be  re-used  more  efficiently
with  less  separation  between  individual  micro-cells.
By  allowing  for  smaller  micro-cells,  the  number  of
potential  micro-cells  within  a  stadium  deployment  can
be increased, improving channel re-use.

Bottom line, especially for venue networks: Increases
in channel re-use increase the system capacity of a high
density network.

1024 QAM
  QAM  (quadratic  amplitude  modulation)  refers  to
a  technique  used  to  embed  data  onto  a  given  Wi-Fi
channel.  Prior  iterations  of  the  Wi-Fi  standards  were
based on less data dense modulation techniques.

  QAM is a signal in which two carriers (two sinusoidal
waves) shifted in phase by 90 degrees (a quarter out of
phase) are modulated and the resultant output consists
of both amplitude and phase variations. These variations
form the basis for the transmitted binary bits, atoms of
the digital world, that results in the information we see
on our devices.

STADIUM TECH REPORT    SUMMER 2019     27

ANALYSIS

  Modulation
to  optimize
techniques  are  used
throughput  and  range.  The  number  of  points  in  the
modulation constellation determines the number of bits
conveyed with each symbol.

  While  not  all  devices  will  achieve  1024  QAM,  the
significant improvement from Wi-Fi 5 to Wi-Fi 6 is simple
math: With 256-QAM, Wi-Fi 5 could transfer 8 bits per
symbol; with Wi-Fi 6, the potential increases to 10 bits
per symbol – a 25 percent increase in potential overall
data rates.

The  bottom  line  for  venue  networks:  1024  QAM
provides the ability for Wi-Fi 6 networks to carry more
data over the same period of time.

8 X 8 MIMO, OR ‘MASSIVE MIMO’
  Wi-Fi  5  first  introduced  the  idea  of  a  radio  chain.
Prior  to  the  introduction  of  the  first  version  of  Wi-Fi
5,  an  individual  radio  within  an  access  point  was  the
combination  of  a  single  transmitter  and  single  receiver
that could be attached to one or more antennas (antenna
diversity), allowing for each radio to communicate with
a  single  device.  In  a  Wi-Fi  5  access  point,  the  single
transmitter/receiver  pair  was  broken  into  multiple
transceiver  pairs  with  a  maximum  of  4  transmitters
and 4 receivers per radio, each coupled with their own
antenna.
  Multi-user  MIMO  was  introduced  in  Wi-Fi  5  wave
2. Using beam forming techniques, MU-MIMO allowed
a single access point to direct multiple streams of data
across  a  given  channel  concurrently.  Within  the  Wi-Fi
standard,  a  4x4  access  point  could  support  concurrent
communication with up to 3 client devices over a single

28        STADIUM TECH REPORT   SUMMER 2019

ANALYSIS

channel.  Wi-Fi  6  builds  on  the  MU-MIMO  capabilities
by increasing the number of supported transmit/receive
pairs within an access point from 4 to 8, doubling the
number of concurrent conversations that can take place
over a given channel.

And while Wi-Fi 5 MIMO only worked for download
traffic, Wi-Fi 6 8x8 MIMO adds support for bi-directional
traffic, an important feature for stadium networks since
much of the big-game data totals are from fans uploading
data  like  pictures  and  video  to  social  media  networks.
Though  the  benefits  of  8x8  MIMO  may  be  delayed
somewhat until client devices and other gear mature to
support the feature, it is a great tool to have to support
future data demands.

Bottom  line:  Venue  Wi-Fi  6  networks  using  8x8
MIMO can have greater capacity by serving more devices
simultaneously.

TARGET WAIT TIME (TWT)

Anyone who has watched their device battery drain
as  it  keeps  seeking  a  Wi-Fi  connection  can  figure  out
the obvious benefit that Target Wait Time will bring to
Wi-Fi 6 networks. The simple premise is that with TWT,
an AP and a client can set up agreed “wake times” for
communications,  limiting  the  number  of  times  a  client
device has to wake up.

This  feature  will  be  extremely  useful  for  networks
using Wi-Fi 6 for Internet of Things (IoT) communications,
since  devices  can  potentially  negotiate  very  long  sleep
times, like hours, or days. This feature is perfect for IoT
devices that only need to communicate once in a while,
like water meters.

The  bottom  line  for  Wi-Fi  6  networks:  Target  Wait
Time brings more cellular-like performance to networks,
reducing  spectrum  contention  and  preserving  device
battery life.

STADIUM TECH REPORT    SUMMER 2019     29

ANALYSIS

Conclusion:  Wi-Fi  6  is  the  generational  leap  in
technology  that  will  enable  stadium  Wi-Fi  systems  to
keep pace with demand

Even as stadium network professionals contemplate
which  technologies  and  which  business  models  make
sense for their venues’ wireless futures, it’s hard to see
any  one  with  the  potential  to  play  a  bigger  role  than
Wi-Fi 6. Even as it takes time for all the features to be
realized as the device and gear ecosystem matures from
Wi-Fi  5  to  Wi-Fi  6,  the  backwards  compatibility  of  the
standards-based 802.11 environment assures that even as
venues move forward, older client devices won’t be left
unconnected.

Even  more  potential  for  stadium  Wi-Fi  networks  is
on the near horizon as the cards continue to fall in the
favor of more unlicensed spectrum becoming available
in the 6 GHz region, a potential windfall of 1,200 MHz

of new spectrum – far more than the 150 MHz currently
being used in the 5 GHz unlicensed bands.

Though  competition  from  other  players  from  the
cellular and CBRS spaces will no doubt make the rulings
around  6  GHz  an  interesting  political  development  to
watch,  the  ability  for  Wi-Fi  6  to  make  Wi-Fi  networks
as  efficient  and  powerful  as  licensed  cellular  networks
should ensure that a good portion of the new airwaves
are set aside for unlicensed use.

For venue networks that are already seeing spectrum
constraint, the new technology in Wi-Fi 6 and the potential
of more new spectrum could be the now-arriving answers
to the question of how stadium networks will keep up
with data demands.

connected the last few years, the team’s desire to have
more mobile insight to fan activity as well as a switch to
a Wi-Fi-centric point of sale system led Oklahoma City to
finally install fan-facing Wi-Fi throughout the venue.

Chris Nelson, manager of information technology for
venue manager SMG, and Tyler Lane, director of technol-
ogy  for  the  Thunder,  spoke  with  Mobile  Sports  Report
about the recent Wi-Fi deployment at Chesapeake Ener-
gy Arena, which went live during the most recent NBA
season.

Though the venue looked at all options, Nelson said
that going under-seat with APs would have been “very
costly” to do, given the large number of retractable seats
in the arena.

If there’s one sure thing about stadium Wi-Fi de-

ployments, it’s that pretty much no two networks
are ever exactly the same. So even as there is a
growing  large-venue  trend  for  putting  Wi-Fi  ac-
cess  points  under  seats  or  in  handrails,  some-
times the traditional top-down method is still the
one that works best.

Such was the case for the first full fan-facing Wi-Fi
network at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City,
home of the NBA’s Thunder. With a large amount of re-
tractable seating in the 18,000-seat venue, an under-seat
approach to Wi-Fi would prove too costly and disruptive,
leading the team to look for connectivity from above.

  While a solid  in-building cellular distributed anten-
na system (DAS) had done a good job of keeping fans

EXPERIENCE AT CHESAPEAKE ENERGY ARENA. A ccording  to  statistics  provid-

ed by the team, the Wi-Fi was
getting  good  traction  as  the
season went on, with a March
16  game  vs.  the  Golden  State
Warriors  seeing  589.3  giga-
bytes of traffic, from 2,738 cli-
ents that connected to the net-
work. Lane said the team employed Jeremy Roach and
his Rectitude 369 firm to assist with the network design;
Roach in the past helped design networks at Levi’s Stadi-
um and Sacramento’s Golden 1 Center.

After testing the top equipment brands available, the
Thunder settled on Ruckus gear, for what they said was a
simple reason, one involving the 96 feet in air space from
the catwalk to the arena floor.

“Ruckus was the only one whose gear could reach

down all the way,” Nelson said.

ADDING TO THE FAN EXPERIENCE

According to the team the deployment saw 410 total
APs used, with 350 in the arena proper and another 60
deployed across the street at the Cox Convention Center.
According to the Thunder’s Lane, the team rolled out the
service  slowly  at  first,  with  some  targeted  testing  and
feedback from season ticket holders.

“We  got  some  good  feedback  and  then  when  we
went to a full rollout we had signage in the concourses,
communications  via  ticketing  services  and  announce-
ments over the PA and on the scoreboard,” to tell fans
about the system, said Lane.

  Now that the Wi-Fi network is in place, Lane said the
Thunder is starting to increase the ways it can add to the
fan  experience  via  digital  means,  including  app-based
features like showing press conferences live and by hav-
ing an artificial intelligence chatbot to help provide fans
with arena information.

“It’s really all about enhancing the fan experience,”
Lane said, with an emphasis on driving digital ticketing
use  in  the  YinzCam-developed  team  app.  Lane  said
that the system also drives a lot of mobile concessions
traffic,  and  added  that  “Ruckus  did  a  fantastic  job  of
asking all the right questions for our food and beverage
partners.” –MSR–
