WIRELESS OUTLOOK FOR 2020:
Will the iPhone 11
drive faster Wi-Fi 6
adoption?

BY PAUL KAPUSTKA

  You may not immediately think of Apple as a huge
driver in the Wi-Fi business, but some initial data points
surfacing at early Wi-Fi 6 network deployments may be
showing that Apple’s decision to include Wi-Fi 6 support
in  its  new  iPhone  11  line  could  end  up  driving  faster
adoption of the latest version of Wi-Fi technology.

asked for any formal numbers but everywhere we go we
keep  hearing  that  stadium  network  users  are  typically
a  majority  of  Apple  devices,  sometimes  as  high  as  70
percent of the active devices. (If this sounds like a good
topic  for  future  in-depth  research,  you  think  the  same
way we do.)

As always with any such predictions we suggest you
order a side grain of salt to go with our year-end crys-
tal-ball outlook for what lies ahead in 2020. But from an
active fall season where we traveled a bunch and talked
to a lot of smart people, here are some other observa-
tions we have for what lies immediately ahead for the
wireless  technology  marketplace  for  stadiums,  arenas
and other large public venues.

  When  the  iPhone  11  line  came  out  in  September
with support for the emerging Wi-Fi 6 standard, it caught
many in the industry a little by surprise, since historically
Apple has been conservative when it comes to putting
new  technology  into  iPhones.  Those  of  us  who  have
been around a bit remember that happening during the
shift to 4G, when iPhones were pretty much a year be-
hind the leading Android platforms in supporting LTE.

1. Wi-Fi 6 adoption may happen faster,
thanks to Apple

If you were building a new stadium or doing a full
Wi-Fi refresh over the past summer, the big budget de-
cision most likely on your plate was whether to go with
Wi-Fi 6 gear or to wait and use Wi-Fi 5 equipment for
now. While those who went the Wi-Fi 6 route may have
paid a higer up-front cost and gone through some of the
normal struggles with first-generation products, some of
the data we are seeing from stadiums with operational
Wi-Fi 6 networks is that Wi-Fi 6 client devices are already
showing up, in not-so-small numbers.

And you can largely thank Apple for that.

  One  unofficial  but  largely  true  statement  we  feel
comfortable in making is that at most stadiums, iPhones
are still the vast majority of devices in use. We haven’t

If you also believe (as I do) that sports fans represent
both ends of the device-adoption curve – meaning that
a certain percentage of fans will have the latest phones,
while others may still have flip phones – it is those for-
ward-leaning fans who most likely got iPhone 11 devices
as soon as they were available. According to the Golden
State Warriors, they are already seeing iPhone 11 traffic
on the Wi-Fi 6 network they have in the bowl seating at
Chase  Center.  And  at  the  University  of  Oklahoma,  the
all-Wi-Fi  6  network  put  in  at  the  football  stadium  this
year saw a growing number of Wi-Fi 6 connections as
the season went on, hitting 2,000+ at one game later in
the year.

So it’s just a drip of data, but enough to be noticed.
Certainly  something  for  you  (and  us)  to  watch  as  the
year progresses and more Wi-Fi 6 networks come on line.

2. CBRS deployments will take time
to arrive

And  even  though  Apple  also  included  support  for
Citizens  Broadband  Radio  Service  (CBRS)  spectrum  in
the iPhone 11 line, we don’t expect to see CBRS deploy-
ments in venues accelerate anytime soon. Though there
was  a  lot  of  CBRS  talk  ahead  of  the  FCC  approval  for
initial  commercial  deployments  (and  a  lot  of  whispers
about numerous trials at venues), so far there have been
only two public announcements of live CBRS networks
inside  sports  stadiums,  and  both  of  these  involve  trial
networks with no real deployment goal, and most sig-
nificantly, no signed contracts.

  While we remain big believers in the utility that the
new bandwidth and LTE support may eventually bring,
it’s easy to see why CBRS faces a slow adoption rate in
sports  venues.  The  main  reason  may  just  be  historical
inertia,  the  same  conservative  approach  that  has  (still!)
kept  many  venues  from  deploying  even  basic  connec-
tivity on the Wi-Fi or cellular fronts. Second may be the
combination of a lack of budget and expertise; because
there is no have-to problem that CBRS solves, teams and
venues don’t need to rush into deployments.

And while we do believe that CBRS will eventually
do great things for applications that need more mobility
and security, the lack of turnkey-type approaches (like,
“here is your CBRS package for parking-lot connectivi-
ty”) makes it a naturally longer sales cycle.

Throw  in  the  fact  that  many  venues  may  also  be
currently facing a Wi-Fi overhaul decision or what to do
next  on  the  cellular  front  as  5G  arrives,  and  you  have
even more reasons for putting CBRS-type discussions on
a  back  burner.  The  good  news  is,  by  the  time  CBRS
starts getting more real, devices will probably have the
dual-SIM  issue  solved  in  a  more  user-friendly  fashion.
When that happens the ability to use CBRS networks as a
sort of Super-DAS should accelerate adoption – but that’s
not a 2020 thing, at least as far as we can tell.

3. 5G is coming, whether anyone wants
it or not
  You  can’t  escape  the  press  releases,  headlines  and
other paid-for proclamations that 5G cellular services are
now  live  in  many  sports  stadiums.  But  given  the  fact
that devices that support 5G are still at a minimum, only
a lucky few fans will likely take advantage of the fast,
low-latency bandwidth, at least for the time being.

  Going back to Apple – which did NOT include sup-
port for 5G spectrum in the iPhone 11 – you can guess
why stadiums that have 5G services are reluctant to talk
about exactly how many users are on the 5G networks.
Here’s a hint: It’s not a lot. The good news for venues
is, however, that since the 5G wars are basically a huge
marketing battle between the largest cellular carriers, that
means that those carriers will basically pay to put those net-

6        STADIUM TECH REPORT WINTER 2019/20

works into venues, so all you really need to do is provide some
space in the rafters and a fiber connection.

At  Mobile  World  Congress  in  Los  Angeles,  we  did
hear  from  Ericsson  and  Verizon  that  early  5G  deploy-
ments in stadiums are showing some welcome surprises,
like “better than expected” ability for signals to roam –
meaning that you can actually (maybe) leave your seat
or twist your phone and not lose the signal.

So while the loudly hyped promises of 5G applica-
tions in venues – virtual reality! fan-provided video! – re-
main just an idea, more good news is that with little user
pressure,  network  engineers,  equipment  vendors  and
service providers all have some time to learn what works
and what doesn’t in a live environment. But for 2020, 5G
in stadiums is more about carrier TV commercials than
real commercial uses.

4. 4G LTE and DAS are still needed
  One of the more-pertinent questions (and the subject
of an upcoming MSR Research report) is what happens
to the 4G LTE and DAS world inside venues, as carriers
want to focus on 5G. The answer here is not as clear, but
what’s undeniable is that 4G LTE services are still going
to be the balance of cellular traffic for at least the next
two years, if not more. That means that venues of all siz-
es still need to have a DAS or small-cell strategy, which
gets tougher as carriers squeeze the margins traditionally
charged by neutral third-party hosts.

If  you’re  a  big  or  high-profile  venue,  you  may  not
have  as  much  to  worry  about,  as  for  places  like  that
(think Super Bowl, NBA/concerts, or any MLB stadium)
it  will  likely  be  business  as  usual  with  carriers  partici-
pating  in  DAS  deployments.  The  biggest  wild  card  on
the DAS business side going into 2020 is the still-unre-
solved question of whether or not T-Mobile and Sprint
will actually become one company. In places like Chase
Center, that means negotiations over how T-Mobile and/
or Sprint will come on to the DAS are on hold. Unfortu-
nately, it’s the customers who will suffer the most as DAS
participation from T-Mobile and Sprint gets delayed.

Another  thing  we’ll  be  looking  at  in  the  upcoming
DAS  and  4G  report  is  what  deployment  methods  will
take  the  lead  going  forward  –  will  the  traditional  top-
down  DAS  antenna  deployment  method  still  work,  or
will under-seat deployments (like the one at Chase Cen-
ter, see report in this issue) proliferate? Another trend to
keep watching is the use of MatSing ball antennas, which
are gaining more acceptance every time we talk to sta-
dium IT teams. Amalie Arena went big with an all-MatS-
ing DAS (using 52 of the big ball antennas) and Fiserv
Forum recently put in 10 MatSings (again, see report in
this issue). We are also hearing of MatSing deployments
happening in football stadiums, so watch for more MSR
info on that front this year. –MSR–

THE WAY

WITH WI-FI 6

BY PAUL KAPUSTKA

OKLAHOMA LEADS
WITH WI-FI 6

F ormerly  among  the  most  conspicuous

Wi-Fi  have-nots
among  big-school
stadiums, the Sooners have now moved
to the front of the class with a network
of  approximately  1,350  access  points  in
their 80,126-seat stadium, all new models
that support the emerging Wi-Fi 6 standard, also known
as 802.11ax. With a deployment led by AT&T, using gear
from Aruba, a Hewlett Packard Enterprise company, and
a design and deployment from AmpThink, using mainly
handrail-mounted  enclosures  in  the  main  bowl  seating
areas, OU fans now have the ability to connect wirelessly
at the most advanced levels, with a technology base that
will support even better performance as the balance of
attendee handsets starts to catch up to the network with
support for Wi-Fi 6.

“We’re  very  excited”  about  the  new  network,  said
David  Payne,  senior  technology  strategist  for  athletics
at the University of Oklahoma’s information technology
department.  Payne,  who  has  been  at  Oklahoma  since
2003,  has  spent  the  last  several  years  shepherding  the
overall stadium Wi-Fi plan into place, starting first with
Wi-Fi  coverage  for  the  stadium  RV  parking  lots,  then
adding  initial  forays  into  stadium  Wi-Fi  deployment

when Oklahoma renovated the south part of the stadium
three years ago. But this past offseason was the big push
to full stadium coverage, a trek that included a switch in
equipment  vendors  that  was  prompted  by  Oklahoma’s
solid commitment to the emerging Wi-Fi 6 standard.

Committed to Wi-Fi 6 for the future

If there was a tricky time to pull the trigger on Wi-
Fi  6,  it  was  this  past  summer,  when  not  every  vendor
in the market could ensure it would have enough gear
on hand to fully supply a big stadium like Oklahoma’s.
And  even  though  Wi-Fi  6  gear  is  new  and  generally
more  expensive  than  previous  versions,  for  Payne  and
Oklahoma  the  long-term  benefits  combined  with  the
periodic ability to refresh something as significant as a
football  stadium  network  made  committing  to  Wi-Fi  6
somewhat of a no-brainer.

Payne,  like  many  other  big-school  IT  leaders,  has
spent years helping administrators and others at budget-
deciding levels of leadership at his school try to understand
the benefits of stadium-wide Wi-Fi connectivity. For many
of  those  years,  it  just  didn’t  make  sense  to  try  to  push
through  the  multi-million-dollar  expense  of  a  project
“that would only be used six or seven Saturdays a year,”
Payne said. “There’s always a difficulty in telling the story
of what value you receive in this since it’s different from
traditional  revenue  streams,”  Payne  said.  “There  isn’t  a
direct dollar seen from Wi-Fi users.”

STADIUM TECH REPORT   WINTER 2019/20     9

But  with  the  late-2018  approval  of  a  capital
expenditure  project  to  revamp  the  football  stadium’s
lower-bowl seating with new handrails, wider seats and
other ADA-related improvements, Payne and the IT team
were able to weave in the extra $3 million (out of a total
project cost of $14.9 million) it would cost to bring full
Wi-Fi coverage to the entire stadium.

“It’s  just  taking  advantage  of  the  timing  to  get
economies of scale,” said Payne. Because of the already-
planned work on the handrails, Oklahoma was able to
add  the  AmpThink-designed  handrail  Wi-Fi  enclosures
(which  use  the  handrail  pipes  to  carry  cabling)  for  a
fraction of the cost of having to do that work as a separate
project, Payne said. The university had also installed new
backbone gear and cabling during the south end zone
renovation, so that cost was already paid for.

The decision to commit to Wi-Fi 6, Payne said, was
based on standard release projections from manufacturers.
“We  paid  close  attention  to  projected  order  availability
and ship dates,” Payne said. “We were felt that if we were
able to receive the gear by June, we could complete the
project on time.”

Though some manufacturers were not sure of being
able to fully deliver Wi-Fi 6 gear, Aruba, Payne said, had
“high confidence” in meeting the deadlines, and won the
deal. According to Payne, all the Aruba gear was shipped
in time to begin construction in June.

“It’s  important  for  us  to  get  the  full  life  cycle  of
technology, so that’s why we decided to go 100 percent
Wi-Fi 6,” Payne said.

Attention to detail an AmpThink hallmark
  On  a  visit  before  and  during  a  home  game  against
Texas Tech in late September, Mobile Sports Report was
able to test the live network in all parts of the stadium,
with strong performance at even the highest seating levels
as well as in sometimes overlooked spots like the long
ramps that fans walk up to get in and out of the venue.

The Oklahoma deployment was part of a very busy
summer  for  AmpThink,  with  similar  Wi-Fi  design  and
deployments at Oklahoma, Ohio State and Arkansas. Like
those two others, Oklahoma’s main bowl AP deployment
was in the patented AmpThink handrail enclosures, each
stamped with the distinctive “OU” logo.

The  handrail  deployment  system,  which  typically
includes a core drill through the concrete floor to bring
wiring  into  the  handrail  tubing,  is  now  a  standard
process for AmpThink, following similar deployments at
the Minnesota Vikings’ U.S. Bank Stadium and at Notre
Dame Stadium, among others. At Oklahoma, AmpThink
said it used 10 different handrail enclosure designs to fit
all the necessary spaces.

AmpThink  president  Bill  Anderson  was  present
during our visit and took great pride in showing off some
of the finer points of an AmpThink deployment, including
a  method  of  using  a  metal  sleeve  and  some  clever
waterproof paint and sealant to ensure that no moisture
finds its way into the holes used for cable delivery.

“We  spend  a  tremendous  amount  of  time  [during
deployments] making sure there isn’t any water leakage
under  the  stands,”  Anderson  said.  “Because  you  never
know  what  is  going  to  be  below.  This  is  a  big  part  of
what we do. We don’t just sell an enclosure.”

  Up  in  the  stands,  we  took  our  first  test  among  the
railing-mounted  enclosures  in  section  6,  row  51,  just
about at the 50-yard line. We got a mark of 68.2 Mbps
/ 58.7 Mbps before the stands were completely full. We
then hiked up to row 67, which was underneath the press
box overhang and served by overhead APs, not railing
enclosures. There we got a speedtest of 27.8 Mbps / 49.5
Mbps, a half hour before kickoff.

The same can be said of AmpThink’s overall network
designs, which it monitors and tests and tweaks as fans
use the system. On the game day we visited, no fewer
than four AmpThink employees were at the stadium in
the  network  control  room,  checking  AP  performance
and network usage.

  One more speedtest in the lower bowl (around the
30-yard line, in row 19) netted a mark of 68.9 Mbps / 61.2
Mbps; then as we walked around to the south end zone,
we got a mark of 38.7 Mbps / 64.3 Mbps in the south
concourse, busy with fans getting food and drink ahead
of the imminent kickoff.

“We’re pretty proud of what we can do,” Anderson
said about the company’s track record for network design
in  large  venues.  “We  have  proven  formulas  which  we
reliably implement.”

Solid speed tests throughout the venue

At 10:20 a.m. local time, just ahead of the early 11 a.m.
kickoff,  Mobile  Sports  Report  started  our  testing  inside
the main-level concourse, where fans were already lining
up  to  purchase  cold  beer,  another  first  at  the  stadium
this season. In the midst of the entering crowds we got a
speedtest of 55.9 Mbps on the download side and 43.7 on
the upload side, an inkling of the strong tests we were to
see everywhere we walked. In the concourses and near
concession stands, a mix of overhead and wall-mounted
APs provided coverage.

12        STADIUM TECH REPORT WINTER 2019/20

The  recently  renovated  south  end  of  the  stadium
has  a  series  of  loge  boxes  and  other  premium  seating
options, and has an overhang which provides additional
real estate for Wi-Fi AP mounting options. Ducking into
a loge box (covered by overhead APs) for a quick test we
got a mark of 36.8 Mbps / 54.2 Mbps just before kickoff.
Moving around to the corner of the south stands for the
pregame ceremonies we got a mark of 33.7 Mbps / 63.8
Mbps even as all the phones were out to capture the team
run-on and school song rendition. After kickoff, we went
into the crowded main east concourse and got a mark of
43.2 Mbps / 46.6 Mbps amidst all the late-arrivers.

on wireless coverage it’s in the stairwells and pedestrian

ramps,  which  may  not  seem  like  an  important  place
to  have  connectivity.  But  at  Oklahoma,  the  multiple
switchbacks  it  takes  to  climb  from  ground  level  to  the
top seating areas are all well covered with Wi-Fi, as we
got a mark of 39.9 Mbps / 29.5 Mbps during a brief rest
stop on our hike to the top of the east stands.

At a concession stand on the top-level concourse we
got a mark of 61.3 Mbps / 70.5 Mbps, as we admired the
neatness of the core drilling we could see that got the
cabling to the underside of the seating areas above. In
the stands we got a mark of 57.5 Mbps / 69.5 Mbps at one
of the highest rows in the stadium, row 24 of section 226,
a half hour after the game’s start.

Hiccups, headaches and increasing
users of Wi-Fi 6

According to Payne our visit coincided with the first
live game with the Wi-Fi 6 software fully turned on, part
of a sort of rolling start to the network deployment which
wasn’t fully live at the first game on Aug. 31.

“It wasn’t without some hiccups and headaches,” said
Payne of the overall deployment, which included a small
number of temporary black-colored handrail enclosures
from AmpThink, which saw its single source of handrail
molding material run out of supply late in the summer.
According  to  Payne  Oklahoma  started  the  season  with
966  radios  working  on  the  network,  ramping  up  with

O klahoma  also  experienced  what

other  venues  deploying  Wi-Fi  6
may  find  –  that  some  of  the  very
oldest devices still in use may have
issues  in  connecting  to  the  Wi-Fi
6  equipment.  Payne  said  one  such
problem surfaced in the press box (where reporters were
using older laptops) but it was solved by creating some
virtual APs which were tuned to an older version of the
Wi-Fi standard.

  OU also didn’t widely promote the network early in
the  season,  but  by  the  Oct.  19  home  game  with  West
Virginia not only was the school promoting the network
on  the  stadium’s  big  video  boards,  the  IT  team  also
added  the  ability  for  students  to  automatically  join  the
stadium network via their regular WiFi@OU SSID used
around campus.

  With 82,620 in attendance for the West Virginia game
the total number of Wi-Fi users took a big jump from the
previous high, with 25,079 unique connections, according
to numbers provided by Payne. When Iowa State came
to Norman on Nov. 9, the network saw its highest usage
with  32,673  unique  users,  who  used  approximately  4.2
terabytes of data while in the stadium.

  What was also interesting to Payne was the number
of devices connected using the Wi-Fi 6 standard, which

currently  is  only  supported  by  a  small  number  of
phones. Payne noted that the first week OU had the Wi-
Fi 6 working in the stadium was the same week Apple
started delivery of its new iPhone 11 line, which includes
support for the new Wi-Fi 6 standard. After seeing 941
devices  connect  on  Wi-Fi  6  at  the  Texas  Tech  game,
Payne said Oklahoma saw a steady increase of Wi-Fi 6
devices at each following home game, with 1,471 at the
West Virginia game and 2,170 at the Iowa State game.

Is AX coming ‘sooner’... rather than later?
Though most consumer handsets being used today
do not support  the Wi-Fi 6 standards, Apple’s decision
to include Wi-Fi 6 support in its latest iPhone 11 line as
well as Wi-Fi 6 support from other new Android phone
models  suggests  that  device  support  for  the  standard
may be coming sooner, rather than later, to the fans in
the stands. When that happens and the Wi-Fi 6 network
starts utilizing its new capabilities, Oklahoma’s network
will be among the first to make use of the new standard’s
ability  to  support  more  clients  at  higher  connection
speeds, critical features for big networks in small places
like football stadiums.

The non-insignificant number of AX devices already
seen by the stadium network, Payne said, felt like good
justification of the school’s decision to commit to Wi-Fi 6.

Looking ahead to next season, Payne said he will be
working with school network officials to see how to more

be able to incorporate a stadium app or web-based sites
to  increase  the  ability  of  the  network  to  improve  the
fan experience. Currently Oklahoma uses a portal from
AmpThink to get email addresses from network guests,
which Payne said will be used by marketing and ticketing
departments to try to increase engagement.

The  good  news  is,  Payne  said,  is  that  “we  are  no
longer looking at what it costs to put a network in place”
to drive any new digital experience ideas.

For  Oklahoma  athletics  director  Joe  Castiglione,  it
was important for the school to deliver an amenity that
provided  a  a  consistent  fan  experience  whether  a  fan
was in a suite or in the upper deck, a goal our tests seem
to have validated.

“We  feel  that  the  Oklahoma  tradition  is  among
the  strongest  in  the  nation  and  really  want  to  provide
a  top-notch  fan  experience  to  celebrate  that  tradition,”
Castiglione said.  “Wi-Fi is just the beginning of enhancing
that experience.  We hope to be able to use it to engage
our  fans  through  in  venue  activations  and  experiences
that  would  not  be  available  without  the  addition  of
Wi-Fi.” –MSR–

CAN WI-FI HELP BRING NEW LIFE TO AN OLD VENUE?
IN A WAY, THAT HAPPENED THIS FALL WHEN THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA
LIT UP A STADIUM-WIDE WI-FI NETWORK AT BEN HILL GRIFFIN  STADIUM,
THE 88,548-SEAT VENUE KNOWN BY MOST AS JUST “THE SWAMP.”

WI-FI AT BEN HILL
GRIFFIN STADIUM

T hough at Florida, like most SEC sta-

diums, the fans don’t really need any
technology to fire them up, the addi-
tion of a NFL-caliber Wi-Fi network
from  Extreme  Networks  and  Veri-
zon  was  quickly  embraced  by  fans
in Gainesville, with one early contest
against  Auburn  cresting  the  11-terabyte  mark  for  total
data used. If nothing else, with the network in place a
whole world outside of the stadium walls gets to see the
arm-chomping craziness that makes Ben Hill Griffin Sta-
dium one of the nation’s premier college football venues,
thanks to social media and other apps that let fans share
their game-day experience.

But  beyond  the  obvious  benefits  for  fans,  the  new
network also brought new features to the Gators’ back-
of-house  business  operations,  including  being  able
to  connect  a  new  point-of-sale  system  for  concession
stands, while also providing the potential for better digi-
tal engagement with the people in the stands. According
to Florida athletic director Scott Stricklin, the addition of
Wi-Fi has given Ben Hill Griffin Stadium somewhat of a
new lease on life, with the ability of the new to augment
the old.

“We had a lot of the inherent challenges of putting
technology into a 90-year-old venue,” said Stricklin, “but
it’s also interesting how technology allows you to work
around those challenges.”

18        STADIUM TECH REPORT WINTER 2019/20

By  partnering  with  stadium-application  developer
VenueNext, which has recently expanded its services to
include  a  back-end  POS  system,  Florida  can  now  offer
fans  at  home  games  a  wide  menu  of  digital-powered
services, like the ability to order food and drinks ahead
of time for pickup at express windows, and the ability to
click on a phone to say “Water Me,” to have cold water
delivered to the sunny-seat sections of the stadium.

For  the  business  of  running  the  stadium,  the  new
VenueNext  POS  system  allowed  Florida  to  shed  its  old
cash-drawer system to one that can now provide a con-
nected way to manage concession stands.

“The  new  app  and  POS  technology  makes  conces-
sions better for everyone, it’s faster for those who order
ahead of time, and the lines are shorter,” Stricklin said.
“It’s  a  fascinating  idea  that  technology  can  extend  the
useful life of a facility.”

Scenes from a retrofit: drilling and conduits
Like many other big-bowl stadiums at the big foot-
ball  schools,  Ben  Hill  Griffin  Stadium  is  a  work  built
over time, with different renovations and additions add-
ing layers of concrete and seating in ways that definite-
ly did not have wireless networking in mind. And like
many other schools, Florida had a tough time historically
making the case for the capital outlay needed to bring
Wi-Fi to a venue that might only see six or seven days of
use a year.

FANS IN THE SUNNY SECTION OF BEN HILL GRIFFIN STADIUM CAN ORDER COLD WATER DELIVERED TO THEIR SEATS
BY USING THE MOBILE APP’S ‘WATER ME’ SERVICE.

At his previous job as athletic director for Mississippi
State,  Stricklin  was  part  of  an  SEC  advisory  board  that
just five years ago didn’t see stadium Wi-Fi as a priority.
Fast forward to 2019, and both the world in general and
Stricklin have changed their views.

“At one point, Wi-Fi was seen as a luxury item [for
stadiums],” said Stricklin. “Now, connectivity is like run-
ning water or electricity. You’ve got to have it.”

An RFP process for a full-stadium Wi-Fi network end-
ed up getting Florida to choose a $6.3 million proposal
from Verizon and Extreme, which have paired together
for  similar  big-stadium  deployments  before,  mainly  at
NFL venues like Green Bay’s Lambeau Field and Seattle’s
CenturyLink Field.

“Obviously they’re experienced,” Stricklin said of the
Extreme-Verizon  pairing.  “The  success  they’ve  had  be-
fore played a big role in increasing our comfort level.”

Like at those stadiums, at Florida Verizon has its own
separate SSID for Verizon customers, who can be auto-
matically connected to the Wi-Fi upon entering the stadi-
um. Other guests can sign in for free via a portal screen.

According  to  Matt  Vincent,  Florida’s  director  of  in-
frastructure operations, construction of the network ac-
tually started during the 2018 season, with small-section

rollouts  of  the  service.  Over  this  past  summer,  howev-
er, the heavy lifting went in, with Extreme finishing the
full-stadium design with 1,478 APs, all Wave2 802.11ac.
Of  that  number,  approximately  1,200  are  in  the  main
seating bowl, with most of those located in under-seat
enclosures.

  Unlike some other under-seat deployments where a
separate  core  drill  was  done  for  each  AP  location,  at
Florida Extreme was able to reduce the number of con-
crete holes needed with some ingenious use of conduit
and metal plating. In many areas of the stands, one hole
through  the  concrete  supports  a  number  of  APs,  with
conduit and metal plating covering the connections un-
der and behind the seats and benches.

If  you  know  what  you  are  looking  for,  when  you
wander the maze of concourses under the seating sec-
tions you can spot a new network of conduit pipes that
bring the cabling from the network out to the seats. In
concourses, clubs and other areas with overhead mount-
ing places, Extreme also used omni-directional antennas
and other typical indoor equipment for coverage.

Getting to 11+ TB with fast, consistent
coverage

At Florida’s biggest home game of the year, an Oct. 5
game against Auburn (a 24-13 Florida victory), Gator fans
used 11.82 terabytes of data on the Wi-Fi network, one of

the top totals ever seen at a college venue. Mobile Sports
Report visited the stadium for a Nov. 9 game against Van-
derbilt,  and  found  strong  performance  on  the  network
stadium-wide,  including  in  harder-to-cover  areas  like
concourses and narrow seating areas under overhangs.

Starting our testing in the club-seating lounge area,
MSR got a Wi-Fi speedtest of 68.6 Mbps on the download
and 65.2 Mbps on the upload, in front of a stuffed alliga-
tor with a very toothy grin. Heading down to the main
entry gate, we got a mark of 50.2 Mbps / 61.8 Mbps as
fans were streaming in just ahead of game time.

An island of connectivity among the
crowds
  While  Florida’s  Vincent  spends  most  of  his  game
days  working  to  assure  the  network  keeps  running  at
top  performance,  he  said  that  stadium  staff  enjoys  the
Wi-Fi as well.

“It’s been just a night and day difference for everyone
since we added the Wi-Fi,” Vincent said, noting a tweet
from a fan during the Auburn game that said “the only
place  in  town  his  phone  could  connect  was  at  the
stadium.”

In  a  somewhat  enclosed  seating  area  on  the  lower
level behind one end zone, we got a test of 21.9 Mbps
/ 29.9 Mbps just as the Gator mascots took the field for
pregame activity. Moving up into the upper deck of sec-
tion 43, we got a mark of 47.8 Mbps / 50.9 Mbps just af-
ter kickoff. Heading under the upper deck stands to the
top concourse we got a mark of 43.6 Mbps / 55.5 Mbps,
while drawing puzzled stares from fans wondering why
we were taking pictures of the metal tubes running up
the back of the seating floor.

Stopping  under  the  other  end  zone  for  a  Gatorade
break, we sat at some loge-type seats and got a mark of
61.2 Mbps / 64.4 Mbps. Then moving back out into the
stands we got our up-close picture of the sign welcom-
ing us to “The Swamp,” where we got a speedtest of 54.0
Mbps / 53.8 Mbps.

  While saying the decision to deploy Wi-Fi was still
somewhat of a leap of faith, Stricklin gave credit to the
Florida staff members who prepared the reports outlin-
ing the benefits such a system could bring to the venue,
for both the fans as well as for the school.

“It’s a little like Indiana Jones when he steps out [over
the cliff] and doesn’t see the floor below him,” Stricklin
said. “It’s an intense capital outlay [to build a Wi-Fi net-
work] and I don’t know that we’ll ever see it all returned
in  terms  of  numbers.  But  again,  I  thank  the  staff  and
partners  like  VenueNext  who  all  had  a  great  vision  of
what a connected stadium could do. With mobile ticket-
ing, you have the opportunity to learn who’s in your sta-
dium. There are concrete ways we can use connectivity
to engage, learn about fans, and keep up with them. It’s
a wise investment.” –MSR–

DRIVES CHASE CENTER EXPERIENCE

CHASE CENTER IS PART OF THE FAN EXPERIENCE. CREDIT ALL PHOTOS: PAUL KAPUSTKA, MSR

Inside the shiny new home of the NBA’s Golden

State Warriors, which sits on the edge of the San
Francisco Bay, is a cellular DAS deployment from
Verizon using Corning gear that may be the new
forward-thinking model for cellular infrastructure
for large public venues like stadiums and arenas.
The  18,000-seat  arena  also  has  a  Wi-Fi  network
using  gear  from  Aruba,  a  Hewlett  Packard  Enterprise
company, which supports the emerging Wi-Fi 6 standard
for communications inside the main seating bowl.

But  if  you’re  attending  a  Warriors  game,  or  one  of
the many concerts scheduled at Chase Center, you may
not  ever  see  the  equipment  that  brings  the  world-class
connectivity to the fans. Both the DAS and the Wi-Fi net-
works utilize an under-seat antenna deployment method,
just  part  of  an  aesthetic  plan  that  does  its  best  to  min-
imize  the  visual  impact  of  antennas  and  other  wireless
gear. Even deeper into the building is all the optical fiber
supporting the networks, with capacity for future needs
already in place.

  During  a  mid-October  visit  before  all  the  networks
were  fully  tuned,  Mobile  Sports  Report  still  got  strong
test results from both Wi-Fi and DAS networks in most
areas in and around the arena, clear confirmation that the
Warriors’ goal of having excellent wireless connectivity at

their new home was right on track. And with the Corn-
ing ONE system in behind a DAS design built from the
ground up with future needs in mind, as well as the ex-
pected capacity gains coming from Wi-Fi 6, the Warriors
and their partners are confident they’ve built a wireless
system worthy of their world-class venue goals.

“We feel extremely proud” of the venue’s wireless sys-
tems, said Brian Fulmer, director of information technol-
ogy for the Golden State Warriors. Though the inevitable
construction delays led to some late nights heading up to
the arena’s Sept. 6 public debut, according to Fulmer all
wireless systems were fully online for the opening Me-
tallica concert, where the arena saw 2.58 terabytes of data
used on the Wi-Fi network with another 2.69 TB used at
another Metallica show a couple days later.

“It was a race to the finish line but we did it, and the

performance speaks for itself,” said Fulmer.

Searching for ‘Best in Breed’

If there was ever a chance to build the best-ever new
arena, Chase Center was probably a once-in-a-lifetime op-
portunity. When you combine the championship run of
the team on the court with a devoted fan base centered
in one of the hottest economic markets ever, you have the
liberty to search for quality instead of bargains on every level.

(Case in point: The Warriors were able to sell out of
their  new  court-level  luxury  suites,  which  have  rooms
just  under  the  stands  that  include  private  wine  lockers
and  can  cost  up  to  $2  million  per  year.  Clearly,  this  is
a model that may not work in places that aren’t Silicon
Valley.)

For  the  privately  financed  $1.4  billion  building,  the
Warriors  turned  to  consulting  firm  Accenture  to  help
determine  the  “best  in  breed”  technology  partners,  es-
pecially  on  the  wireless  front.  Several  Warriors  execu-
tives interviewed for this story did all agree on one main
point: The team was not trying to install any technology
to  win  imaginary  awards  for  being  the  best  or  fastest
building out there. Instead, it was all about how technol-
ogy, especially wireless, could help bring about a world-
class experience during every visit.

“Nobody shows up [at an arena] just looking for fast
wireless  speeds,”  said  Mike  Kitts,  the  Warriors’  senior
vice  president  for  partnerships.  “They  want  to  interact.
We wanted to create unforgettable experiences in an en-
gaging environment. With the end in mind of a world-
class experience, we knew great technology would abso-
lutely play a role.”

Like a team drafting top players, the Warriors ended

up choosing Verizon to lead the distributed antenna sys-
tem (DAS) for cellular wireless, and Aruba for Wi-Fi. To
build its neutral-host system, Verizon chose Corning and
the  Corning  ONE  platform,  with  an  installation  led  by
Communication Technology Services (CTS).

“We certainly leveraged the expertise of Verizon, as
well  as  AT&T  (which  is  also  on  the  DAS  as  a  client),”
said Fulmer. “They’ve done this countless times, and they
have the lessons learned of painful experiences.”

Building a DAS that can handle growth

Anyone in the stadium business in Northern Califor-
nia doesn’t have to look too far or remember too long ago
to recall one such example of the pain that the nonstop
growth in cellular demand can cause. After the San Fran-
cisco 49ers’ brand-new home, Levi’s Stadium, opened in
2014, the also brand-new DAS had to be upgraded the
very  next  season  to  ensure  it  had  enough  capacity  for
the upcoming Super Bowl 50. Verizon, which basically
invented under-seat DAS antennas for that deployment,
said  it  had  a  goal  at  Chase  Center  to  build  a  DAS  that
didn’t need upgrading for at least a few years.

Terry  Vance,  senior  manager  for  Verizon’s  Pacific
market network performance group, said “the plan from
day  1  was  to  build  a  DAS  with  capacity  for  today  and

tomorrow. We needed to build this DAS so that for the
next 3 to 4 years, we won’t have to touch it.”

Verizon also had to build the DAS in a way that com-
plied with the Warriors’ stringent requirements for clear
sight  lines,  especially  in  the  main  bowl  seating  area.
According to the Warriors’ Fulmer, the team “looked at
handrail [enclosure] designs,” but rejected them in favor
of an under-seat approach. Though more costly in both
equipment  and  construction,  the  under-seat  approach
was Verizon’s favored method as well to get more density
in the arena.

  What Verizon ended up with was a design that cur-
rently uses 71 active sectors, with 42 of those in the seat-
ing bowl. According to Vance, all the sectors in the bowl
area can basically be split into two parts if needed, for a
total of 84 potential bowl sectors. Currently, Vance said
there are 598 under-seat DAS antennas in use.

not part of the shared DAS system, Verizon also has full
5G bowl coverage at Chase Center, one of the first arena
deployments in California. Verizon also is using a couple
of MatSing ball antennas, mounted in the rafters to pro-
vide cellular coverage to the floor area for concerts and
other non-basketball events. Right now AT&T is the only
other carrier on the DAS, with participation from T-Mo-
bile and/or Sprint pending depending upon the outcome
of those two companies’ potential merger.

Jessica  Koch,  sports  and  entertainment  director  of
business  development  for  Corning  optical  communica-
tions,  gave  praise  to  integrator  CTS  for  its  deployment
know-how,  which  she  said  was  “critical  to  the  success
of this project.” Corning, Koch said, knows that for fans
in large venues like Chase Center, “reliable connectivity
without restriction – all the time, at full speed, on any
device, from anywhere – has become the expectation in
our connected world.”

According to Vance the Corning ONE system’s exten-
sive use of optical fiber makes it easier to add capacity to
the system as needed.

For Warriors president and COO Rick Welts, the best
wireless system is one fans don’t see or worry about, but
just use without concern.

“The fiber to the edge [in the Corning system] is es-
pecially useful as you go to 5G,” Vance said. Though it’s

“The best thing is if the phone just works, and I don’t
have  to  think  about  it,”  said  Welts,  who  led  a  stadium
tour during MSR’s October visit.

Though Verizon said the system went through some
necessary  optimization  during  the  hectic  early  events
schedule at Chase Center, Verizon engineers are current-
ly getting DAS speed tests in excess of 100 Mbps for both
download  links  in  most  locations,  according  to  Philip
French, vice president of network engineering for Veri-
zon. Download speeds for 5G connections, he said, are
breaking the 1 Gbps mark.

“This DAS is unique since it was the first one we’ve
built with 5G in mind from the ground up,” French said.
“It’s a very robust design, and for us this is the design of
the future.”

Leading the way with Wi-Fi 6

Like several other stadiums that were being finished
this past summer, Chase Center was able to take advantage
of the release of Wi-Fi equipment that supports the emerg-
ing Wi-Fi 6 standard. Though all the new capabilities won’t
be fully realized until most end-user devices also support
the new version of Wi-Fi, having support for the technolo-
gy inside the arena was key for the Warriors’ plans.

“You  can  never  really  be  ‘future  proofed’  but  we
were extremely fortunate with the timing [of Wi-Fi 6 gear
arriving],”  said  the  Warriors’  Fulmer.  “We  were  right  in
the sweet spot for an initial deployment.”

According to Aruba, Chase Center has approximately
250  Aruba  500  Series  APs  (which  support  Wi-Fi  6)  de-
ployed  in  the  main  seating  bowl,  mostly  in  under-seat

enclosures.  Overall,  there  are  approximately  852  total
APs  used  in  the  full  Chase  Center  network,  which  in-
cludes coverage inside the building as well as in the con-
nected outdoor plaza areas.

  During our October visit, MSR got Wi-Fi speedtests
of 27.3 Mbps on the download side and 18.2 Mbps on the
upload side while standing outside the east entry doors
near the big mirror balls that are selfie central for fans
visiting the new arena. Inside the doors, our speedtest in
the lobby got a mark of 55.8 Mbps / 68.6 Mbps.

  On one upper concourse area, near several conces-
sion stands outside portal 57, we got a speedtest of 10.5
Mbps / 11.2 Mbps. In the seats in upper section 220 just
before tipoff we got a mark of 46.0 Mbps / 28.0 Mbps,
and in a lower-bowl concourse area outside portal 9 we
got a test mark of 53.7 Mbps / 71.5 Mbps.

According  to  Aruba,  several  events  other  than  the
Metallica concerts have passed the 2 TB Wi-Fi data mark
so far, with several events seeing more than 8,000 unique
clients connected and marks of 6,000+ concurrent con-
nected devices and 2.6 Gbps of throughput.

The Warriors’ Fulmer praised not just the Wi-Fi gear
but the full “end to end network solutions” available from
Aruba as well as from parent Hewlett Packard Enterprise,
which is a founding partner at Chase Center.

“We’re  still  only  three  months  in,  and  there’s  a  lot
more  that  we  want  to  do,”  Fulmer  said.  “It  was  not  a
small undertaking. But I think we can let the technology
speak for itself.” –MSR–

WIRELESS NETWORKS
READY FOR
DEMOCRATIC
CONVENTION

AT FISERV FORUM

W ith one of the most demand-

ing arena-sized events head-
ed  its  way  this  upcoming
summer,  the  wireless  net-
works  at  Milwaukee’s  Fiserv
Forum  appear  to  be  more
than ready to handle any au-

dience demand for mobile connectivity.

  With a full-featured distributed antenna system (DAS)
deployed  and  operated  by  ExteNet  Systems  using  gear
from JMA Wireless, as well as a Wi-Fi network using Cis-
co gear, Fiserv Forum shows both the expertise of wire-
less providers who have a long history of knowing what
works,  as  well  as  the  foresight  to  add  new  techniques
and technologies to combine high performance with the
quality aesthetics that are the hallmark of the new home
of the NBA’s Milwaukee Bucks.

And while a Mobile Sports Report visit this fall for a
Bucks game found all the wireless elements in top work-
ing order, the big event for the venue’s second year of
operation will be the Democratic National Convention in
July 2020. While the four-day nomination gathering is a
test for any locale, Fiserv Forum’s forethought on how to
prepare for numerous types of events in and around its
uniquely designed structure has it well prepared to han-
dle whatever wireless needs the convention will require.

36        STADIUM TECH REPORT WINTER 2019/20

It all starts with the DAS

Even  in  these  days  of  predictions  of  the  death  of
DAS, Fiserv Forum is proof that for high-profile venues,
carriers will still participate in a quality deployment. And
while many venues have just two or three cellular pro-
viders  on  their  DAS,  according  to  ExteNet,  the  Fiserv
Forum DAS has five major carriers participating – AT&T,
Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint and U.S. Cellular.

  Unlike some new arenas, where wireless is an after-
thought to construction, ExteNet was involved early on,
according to Manish Matta, vice president of marketing
at Extenet.

“Getting in sooner rather than later is always better,”
said Matta, who said ExteNet was well involved in the
overall construction plans, ensuring that there were no
delays associated with wireless deployments holding up
construction of other parts of the building.

  During a pregame tour in October with a team from
ExteNet as well as with Robert Cordova, chief technolo-
gy and strategy officer for the Bucks, Mobile Sports Re-
port got an up-close look at some of the inside parts of
the  DAS  network  design,  including  the  headend  room
and multiple antenna installations that were hard to find
given their well-designed placements and camoflauging.

In addition to regular enclosures that were painted
or otherwise placed in areas out of the main sight lines,
ExteNet and JMA also utilized some of the newer circu-
lar flat-panel antenna enclosures that fit flush to ceilings,
minimizing the exposure.

the pregame introductions were at their peak, we got a
DAS mark of 18.0 Mbps / 15.7 Mbps in the middle of an
upper-deck  seating  area  (Section  227)  and  then  a  little
bit after the game started, we got a mark of 21.3 Mbps /
12.5 Mbps near a bar area on the upper-level concourse.

The  215  DAS  antennas  are  powered  by  40  remote
units. According to JMA, the remotes are connected to
the backbone with optical fiber, and use digital power
to bring power to elements up to a mile away. With 16
sectors in the bowl design, the DAS is able to segment
coverage to all parts of the arena, including the bowl as
well as concourses and other in-house areas.

ExteNet, which owns and operates the DAS as a neu-
tral  host,  also  installed  10  extra  MatSing  ball  antennas
in the rafters for additional top-down coverage. Though
only AT&T is using the MatSings right now, ExteNet said
they are integrated into the DAS design if other carriers
should wish to utilize them in the future.

During  a  short  walk-around  before  the

Bucks  game  started,  MSR  got  a  DAS
speedtest  of  85.8  Mbps  on  the  down-
load  and  14.9  Mbps  on  the  upload,
even though our older iPhone (on the
Verizon  network)  doesn’t  support  all
the latest DAS capabilities. Near the start of the game, as

Wi-Fi inside and out
  On the Wi-Fi side of things, a visitor to Fiserv Forum
can connect to the network even before coming in the
doors, as part of the 623-AP Cisco installation includes
Wi-Fi APs mounted on light poles in the “Deer District,”
the plaza area on the stadium’s east side that connects to
an outdoor beer garden and several bars and restaurants
that  were  all  part  of  the  planned  environment  built  in
sync  with  the  arena’s  opening.  Before  we  went  inside,
we  got  a  Wi-Fi  speedtest  of  40.5  Mbps  /  40.2  Mbps  in
the middle of the Deer District plaza, which was hosting
a  pop-up  haunted  house  attraction  sponsored  by  Jack
Daniels.

Inside the building, we again needed some guidance
from the Bucks’ Cordova to locate some of the Wi-Fi APs,
which  are  inside  triangular  enclosures  that  are  either
painted to match wall surfaces, or utilized as high-visibil-
ity section number signs, hiding the gear in plain sight.

commitment  to  aesthetics  with  the  smallest  handrail

Looking ahead to CBRS and 5G

As ExteNet and JMA prepare for the onslaught of the
convention’s needs, in many areas the Bucks are already
looking  farther  ahead,  to  future  communications  im-
provements including 5G millimeter wave deployments,
and a possible introduction of CBRS services. Cordova,
who  is  an  advocate  of  the  capabilities  of  private  LTE
networks over the CBRS spectrum, said the flexibility of
provisioning  services  in  a  CBRS  environment  could  be
extremely  useful  for  temporary  needs,  like  during  last
year’s NBA playoffs when the NBA on TNT crew set up
a temporary stage out in the plaza.

  While the Bucks have already prepared for connectiv-
ity of all sorts out on the plaza space – from the top-level
outside  Panorama  deck  at  Fiserv  Forum  that  lets  fans
look out over the city, Cordova pointed out several metal
boxes in the plaza that have home-run fiber connections
for broadcast TV as well as remote power – there’s going
to be all sorts of temporary connectivity needs when the
convention media tents set up in the empty lot next door
where the previous stadium, the Bradley Center, used to
stand.

enclosures  we’ve  ever  seen,  a  discreet  hand-sized  en-
closure  that  tucks  the  antenna  components  neatly  into
the top part of a railing, with the AP electronics hidden
below  the  seating  areas.  Designed  by  integrator  John-
son  Controls  and  its  ecosystem  partners,  Abaxent  and
AccelTex, the 28 special enclosures are also designed to
be easy to detatch and re-attach (with a simple two-click
“dart connector”) which facilitates keeping the network
working when the lower-bowl seating areas need to be
reconfigured for different events.

Sitting  in  a  courtside  seat  near  one  of  the  handrail
enclosures about 20 minutes before tipoff, we got a Wi-Fi
speedtest mark of 15.8 Mbps / 33.2 Mbps. On the main
concourse just after the game’s start we got a Wi-Fi mark
of  28.6  Mbps  /  60.4  Mbps,  and  later  on  at  that  same
upper-concourse bar we got a mark of 39.9 Mbps / 61.1
Mbps.

Later  on  during  the  second  quarter  of  the  game,
we watched another fan in our lower-bowl seating area
spend most of the period keeping one eye on Monday
Night  Football  streaming  on  his  phone.  “The  Wi-Fi  is
really good here,” he noted.

The  fact  that  the  Bucks  and  ExteNet  were  already
well involved with planning for a July event in October
the year before is just another sign of a networking op-
eration that is well positioned now and already thinking
about what the next necessary steps are. –MSR–
