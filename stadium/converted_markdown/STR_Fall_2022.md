CAN TECHNOLOGY
HELP VENUES SOLVE
STAFFING ISSUES?

If staffing is the biggest concern facing
stadiums and venues right now, how
can technology help? So far, we’re
already seeing many stadiums using new
technologies to help cope with the staffing
shortages -- with changes we are guessing
are here to stay.

If you haven’t yet downloaded our
results and white paper from our
2022 Stadium Connectivity Outlook
Survey, you should do that now.
One of the more interesting year-
to-year comparisons came in a
question about top concerns venue
IT operators might have. Last year,
as no huge surprise, dealing with the
Covid pandemic was the top concern.

But this past year, with Covid issues
greatly diminished, a new concern
rose to the top of the list as stadiums

started refilling again: Trying to
find enough people to staff all the
necessary jobs it takes to open the
doors on any venue, from ticketing
to security to concessions and
everything in between.

While Covid as its own concern
was far down the list this year,
repercussions from the pandemic
are no doubt a big part of the staffing
shortages. In the midst of a lot of
people leaving lower-paying jobs
for better-paying, work-from-home

opportunities, it’s perhaps no
surprise that stadium jobs -- many of
which are on the lower end of the pay
scale and also very part-time and at
undesirable work times (nights and
weekends) -- are less attractive. So
how can (and did) stadiums react?

LET THE FANS DO THE WORK

The most obvious shift we’ve seen
to address the staffing shortage
is a wholesale move to as many
self-serve procedures as possible,
starting with stadium entry. Security
scanning, which used to almost
always require fans to stand in front
of someone and empty pockets into
bins before going through metal
detectors, is now morphing into a
much more contact-free encounter.

New technologies in the security
scanning space from companies
like Evolv, CEIA, and Xtract One (a
company that just changed its name
from Patriot One) are designed for
fans to simply walk through without
divesting any items, and for the most
part, not stopping unless they trigger
a positive security result. While
staffers are still needed as part
of the equation -- and may need a
higher level of training since the new
scanners don’t conveniently slow
people down -- pretty much every
stadium we’ve talked to with the new
equipment says that overall, fewer
staff are needed.

Ticketing is also going through a
self-serve revolution, with many
places now using devices on

pedestals for fans to self-scan digital
tickets instead of having a staffer
do that work with a handheld device.
Newer models from leaders in the
field like Axess are showing a quick
learning curve for the technology
providers, addressing problems
like being able to scan in bright
sunlight (a huge problem with early
scanning devices) and having the
ability to support multiple ticketing
technologies, including NFC (near-
field communications).

Some stadiums are also seeing early
success with facial authentication
systems that tie a face to a ticket,
allowing fans to walk in without
having to pull out a device (see
feature on facial authentication
systems in this issue). In all these
new iterations, a smaller number of
staff are generally needed to keep the
same amount of gates covered.

KIOSKS, SELF-SCAN DEVICES AND
CHECKOUT-FREE CONCESSIONS

Self-serve and other staff-reducing
technologies have simply taken over
many stadium concession stands.
After decades of doing concessions
the same old time-consuming way
-- one person taking an order, turning
around to fill it, adding it up and taking
payment -- stadium concession
stands are now catching up with
the rest of the world when it comes
to things like kiosks for ordering
and payment, optical scanners for
checkout, and even checkout-free
stores where you scan a card (or even

the palm of your hand) before walking
in and then walking out with your
purchases, which will be charged to
you later.

Born a bit from the post-Covid desire
to reduce human to human contact,
kiosk technology makes a ton of
sense in a stadium situation. With
a bank of kiosk terminals outside
a stand, multiple people can order
at once; then instead of waiting
for one-by-one fulfillment in a line,
people who have ordered (and paid)
can simply wait in an area close by
the stand, picking up their order
when it is ready, most often by seeing
their order number displayed on an
overhead screen.

While fans will probably always want
some kind of stand available with a
list of multiple items, many stadiums
have added a number of so-called
“grab and go” stands, which usually
offer a limited number of fan-favorite
items. Many of these stands are also
taking advantage of new technology
like the optical scanners from
Mashgin, where fans place items on a
platform where cameras “see” what
items are there and then total up a
bill, which is then paid via an attached
card reader.

And then there’s the checkout-free
stands, which have simply exploded
this fall with new stores announced
every week. Using technology from
one of three leading companies, a
list that includes Zippin, Amazon
and AiFi, stadiums are seeing great

acceptance by fans who can often
get a drink or a snack in seconds.
And the stands are adding quickly to
the stadiums’ bottom lines, in many
places generating revenue from
previously empty concourse space.

Like the grab and go stands, some
staffing is needed, especially for ID
verification for alcohol purchases. But
according to concessionaire Delaware
North, which has installed a number
of such stands at stadiums where it
operates, the staffers are more now
like ambassadors or concierges,
helping fans figure out the new
systems in a friendly, helpful way.

NEW JOBS, HIGHER PAY?

While stadiums are always going to
need stockers, cooks, cleaners and
other labor-intensive workers, the
time-consuming, brain-numbing
tasks of adding up totals or punching
or scanning tickets are being quickly
replaced by machines that can do
those jobs much faster and more
accurately.

For most of the stadiums we have
talked to, they are quick to point out
that they aren’t looking to get rid of
staff with more technology -- the
idea is, you can now take staffers
and move them to a different, more
interesting (and potentially higher-
paying) position, making things better
all the way around.

BRING NEW WI-FI
TO LOUISVILLE’S
CARDINAL STADIUM

You know that old saw about how it takes a lot of
wires to build a wireless network? Well, here’s a
new spin: Sometimes it takes a lot of concrete too.

In what has to be one of the more unique

Wi-Fi stadium network installs anywhere,
the University of Louisville now has a
high-capacity Wi-Fi 6 network in Cardinal

Stadium, thanks to the network design as well as
the concrete-pouring skills of a deployment team
led by AT&T and AmpThink.

There are more details behind the story, but
because of an inability to install under-seat
antennas in much of the 60,000-seat stadium,
the design teams opted for a system of antennas
in handrail enclosures for most of the seating
bowl. But to get all the wires to the wireless
gear required the building of a complex in-bowl
conduit circuit -- which required the demolition
of, and the reconstruction of, 185 concrete steps.
And did we mention the five-month timeframe
this all had to happen in?

For those wanting to know quickly how it all
turned out, the network was almost 100 percent
functional by the season’s opening day, with
the stadium tech crew seeing 3.1 terabytes of
data used on the 1,200-AP network, which used
gear from Aruba, a Hewlett Packard Enterprise
company.

the suppliers a tight window to get construction done
before the fall.

While under-seat Wi-Fi deployments are often a first
design choice due to the density of coverage they can
provide, the history of the land underneath Cardinal
Stadium made it largely impossible to go that route. When
the stadium was originally built in 1998, it used land that
had been a train yard for most of the past century.

“We had good coverage and
good speeds,” said Jason
Bond, Louisville’s director
of technology. “I had friends
at the game who said they
were streaming the game on
their phones, and watching
replays. That’s how you know
the network’s good.”

NO DIGGING IN THE DIRT

According to Bond, at one point in late 2021 the long-
held plans for bringing Wi-Fi to Cardinal Stadium --
delayed in part by Covid shutdowns -- were still on hold,
with no deals signed.

But according to Dennis Myer, client solutions
executive for AT&T, the carrier, which had been
negotiating with the school on the idea, found a way
to use an existing services contract with the state of
Kentucky that would provide the resources needed
to build the stadium network. So near the end of 2021
the project was green-lighted, giving the school and

“There’s a lot of dirty dirt there,” said Michael Ortman,
Louisville’s associate athletic director and facilities
and stadium manager, who estimated that more than a
million gallons of diesel oil was spilled into the railroad
grounds over its long history. As such, Louisville cannot
dig much around the stadium property.

“It didn’t take long for everyone to decide, let’s stay out
of the dirt,” Ortman said.

The next design choice was to use a handrail-based
enclosure approach, one made even more solid when
AT&T chose master technology integrator AmpThink
to lead the install. AmpThink, which has a heralded
history of stadium network design, deployment and
operation, had a long list of handrail-based networks in
its resume, including U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis,
Notre Dame Stadium, Ohio Stadium at the Ohio State
University, and the University of Oklahoma’s Gaylor
Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium.

AT&T’s Myer also noted AmpThink’s can-do approach
to construction challenges as another reason the firm
was selected.

“We knew AmpThink’s reputation of being able to
accomodate [challenges] better than anyone else,”
Myer said. “We’re glad we chose them.”

BUCKET BRIGADE TO REBUILD THE STEPS

According to Eric Miller, AmpThink senior project
manager who headed up the Louisville network build,
the network deploy at Cardinal Stadium was a true roll
up the sleeves kind of project.

“Getting the lower bowl
done was a huge physical
construction challenge,”
Miller said.

To bring cable to the railing enclosures, AmpThink
needed to build a multi-path conduit network under
the seats. But to get those conduits to cross stairways
meant taking jackhammers to the old steps and

AmpThink’s patented designs brought the Cardinal logo to
all the railing enclosures.

pouring new ones with conduit pipes enclosed inside.
In all, AmpThink demolished and re-poured 185 step
locations, Miller said, with 11 of those being double-high
step areas that required four times the concrete of the
regular steps.

What made the work even more challenging than the
90-day deadline to get the construction completed was
the fact that concrete pouring equipment couldn’t be
easily brought to the steps -- so the team had pouring
stations inside the stadium concourse, and brought
concrete to each step using buckets, Miller said.

Then came the enclosures themselves, which of
course presented another challenge to AmpThink’s
engineers. While AmpThink prides itself on its patented
enclosure manufacturing -- which includes stamped-
in team logos to make the enclosures stand out
-- the varied design of the stadium added a degree of
difficulty.

“There was no even slope to things -- we had to design
the logos to fit eight different angles of slope,” Miller
said, a task that required AmpThink crew members
to walk every stairway to measure the precise angle

Clockwise from left: Conduit lines went from seating areas through an entry
to the concourse; a conduit liine under the seats; a spot where the pipes went
through the new steps.

A concourse AP points down from underneath the stands

needed to make sure that the logos on that stairway’s
enclosures sat straight.

In the end, there was what Miller called “a perfect sea of
silver enclosures,” 336 in total covering the upper and
lower bowls.

“It’s a really slick build,” said Louisville’s Ortman. The
network also included another 45 under-seat APs in
the north end zone seating, as well as approximately
200 APs for back of house use. AmpThink also ended
up digging a tunnel across the road outside the stadium
to bring the network to a mixed-use space across the
street where the school plans to host activities like
away-game watch parties.

OTHER IMPROVEMENTS

The new network follows a recent $63.25-million dollar
expansion of the stadium, in which approximately
6,000 seats were added to increase the total capacity
to about 60,000. Other new technology adds include
two 40-foot by 80-foot LED videoboards in the north
end zones and a 24-foot by 92-foot videoboard for the
south end zone.

But the new Wi-Fi network may end up being the
amenity enjoyed by most of the fans who now attend
games, especially since the previous Wi-Fi coverage
was almost nonexistent.

provided mounting spaces. Bottom: Small IDFs in the concourses

“We had some Wi-Fi for
ticket scanning and some
coverage in club areas, but
there really was no fan-
facing Wi-Fi to speak of,”
Louisville’s Bond said.

A cellular distributed antenna network (DAS) was
installed by Boingo in 2014, but it didn’t include
AT&T, whose customers now enjoy automatic
offload to the Wi-Fi network.

According to Bond, fans took to the network
immediately, with 10,000 on the Wi-Fi for the home
opener, and averages of around 12,500 using the
network later in the fall. According to everyone
involved, the project took up a lot of late nights and
extra hours, but to have happy, well-connected
fans is worth the effort.

“We get very few complaints [about the network],”
Bond said. “It’s something our fans are going to
expect now.”

F acial authentication technology may be the next new thing to start

multiplying soon at stadiums, as initial deployments are drawing
rave reviews from both fans and venues for their ability to speed
up identification-based transactions.

For uses including stadium entry, security checks and concessions-based
age verification, facial authentication systems at stadiums like First
Energy Stadium in Cleveland, Citi Field in New York and Mercedes-Benz
Stadium in Atlanta are showing early positive results, with venue operators
scheduling expansion plans after successful trials.

or for purchasing alcoholic
beverages, with the process
simplified by being able to
simply stare into a screen
instead of having to stop to
show some form of physical
identification. For venues
the benefits include less
crowding, more granular
control of identity-based
operations and the ability
to increase sales while also
producing a much better
overall fan experience.

If there is one general
agreement across the venue
technology landscape, it’s that
necessary respones to the Covid pandemic -- like all-
digital ticketing and cashless concessions -- greatly
accelerated acceptance of those new practices.

But while the moves to all-digital ticketing and card-
only purchases did improve the fan experience by
improving some line speeds, even with those systems
in place there is still a lingering amount of what is
commonly called “friction” -- like the need for fans to
figure out how to download tickets and properly scan
them at a pedestal, or the need for fans to still pull out
a physical ID when purchasing alcohol -- that produces
game-day lines.

Using facial authentication technology, however,
could be a big next step in eliminating some of those
remaining delays. One of the emerging leaders in the
space is a Cambridge, Mass.-based startup named
Wicket, whose software runs on Apple iPads as the
hardware interface that people look at.

An important note here is the distinction between
“facial authentication” and “facial recognition,” which
according to the suppliers are not equal terms. Unlike
some public-safety systems that store facial images

for comparison and verification, Wicket says its
system doesn’t actually store any facial information
anywhere on the device but instead uses what it calls
its “facial authentication” system, which uses artificial
intelligence to map a photo of a face digitally, and uses
that code to authenticate people by matching the code
to a live face.

While systems like Wicket’s are always likely to
cause some pause from potential users because of
privacy concerns, the authentication vs. recognition
distinction is one that the company and its clients hope
can increase confidence for operators and end users.
Several venues using Wicket also point to the fact
that Apple’s introduction of Face ID starting with the
iPhone X in 2017 has made the technology much more
acceptible to the phone-using public.

“Two or three years ago, we weren’t sure how [public
acceptance of] facial recognition would go,” said Karl
Pierburg, chief technology officer for the Atlanta
Falcons and for AMB Sports and Entertainment. “But
now, if you have an iPhone, you use it every day.”

5GMULTIPLE TICKETS A BREEZE WITH FACIAL
AUTHENTICATION

If there is one place where facial authentication shines
it is when fans come to the stadium as a group, usually

has now been in place for more than a year, and at
football games. Oscar Fernandez, vice president of
technology solutions with the Mets, said the success of
a pilot program in 2021 led to the Mets having Wicket-
enabled systems at every entry gate this past season.

According to Fernandez the Mets have signed up 4,500
fans to use the Wicket systems at games.

Brandon Covert, vice president for information
technology with the Cleveland Browns, said the team’s
pilot test this season of Wicket technology is off to a
fast start, with as many as 6,000 fans out of a capacity
crowd of 60,000 using facial authentication to get into
the stadium.

The quick lines to get in using the Wicket system are
especially helpful at one gate area where there isn’t
a lot of real estate between the venue and a nearby
street, Covert said. Though it does take some sign-up
action to use the Wicket system -- fans have to enroll
with a selfie and payment and ticketing information --
Covert said the Browns already have more than 21,000
active accounts.

Both NFL teams are also using the systems for other
identity-check procedures, like club spaces and field
access.

FASTER ID CHECKS FOR CONCESSIONS

The Browns have taken the lead on the concessions
front by partnering with Wicket and a couple startup
firms for something called the “Cleveland Cold Ones,”
where fans can order a beer on their mobile device and
then when they go to pick it up at a special stand, need
to only show their face to a Wicket iPad for age and
payment confirmation.

“For us it’s all about trying to find best ways to get
people back to games quickly,” said Alicia Woznicki,
vice president of sports & entertainment for Aramark,
the Browns’ concessionaire. While the Cleveland Cold
Ones idea had already existed without Wicket, Woznicki

account to all walk in quickly. Credit: Cleveland Browns. Right: The Atlanta Falcons have a

with all the tickets purchased under one name. Instead
of having to scan each ticket code individually -- which
most optical scanning systems still require -- with
Wicket’s technology when the ticket purchaser is
confirmed, everyone else can just follow along in line
without stopping.

According to technology teams that have deployed
Wicket, the system works great at both baseball
stadiums, like at Citi Field where Wicket technology

“We saw that getting into the
stadium could be a friction-
intensive experience,”
Fernandez said. “Now we
have something that’s easy to
use, and makes the fans feel
welcome.”

Like the Browns, the Falcons combine the Wicket gates
with the new walk-through security scanning systems
from Evolv, a combination that provides one of the
fastest street-to-seat procedures anywhere.

“The whole notion is for the fans to not break stride,”
said AMBSE’s Pierburg. “We want to make it so you can
go from your car to your seat, and get a hot dog and
beer, and not stop on the way.”

said “we thought, wouldn’t it be great if you also didn’t
have to pull out an ID.”

To use the system, fans must enter more pre-
transaction information, including a selfie and photos
of their legal ID. The procedure uses mobile app
technology from TapIn2 as well as an age-verification
system developed by a company called IDmission. The

new self-ordering drink stands from TendedBar, which
have started to appear in some other NFL stadiums,
also use facial authentication for age verification.

CONNECTIVITY IS A KEY CORE NEED

If there is a key tech underpinning facial authentication
it is the need for fast, low latency communications
between the fan-facing systems and the back end,
since there is a non-trivial amount of information
that needs to be exchanged to do the confirmations.
Wicket’s choice of Apple iPads is based in part on the
solid connectivity found in the off-the-shelf devices,
which include a wide range of cellular bands, including
some more esoteric ones like CBRS and Wi-Fi 6 (and
now 6E).

In Cleveland, Covert and the Browns installed a small
CBRS network from Celona to power the Wicket
devices, so that the Wicket system didn’t have to
compete with the public Wi-Fi in the crowded area. In
Atlanta, Pierburg said the Falcons have “very robust

Wi-Fi” covering the plaza areas where the Wicket
systems are in use, so they connect there via Wi-Fi.

MAKING FANS HAPPY, REPLACING PAIN POINTS WITH
BETTER BUSINESS

While most venues who are deploying the systems
don’t ever expect that all fans will want to make the
effort to divulge photos and other information, putting
facial-authentication systems side-by-side with
traditional entry gates can be a big selling point, when
one gate has a line and the other doesn’t.

“Some people don’t want it, and we understand that,”
said AMBSE’s Pierburg. “But watching the fans who
do use it, it’s fun to watch their eyes light up when the
screen flashes their name.”

GETS NEW
EXTREME WI-FI 6
NETWORK

Wi-Fi 6 deployment from Extreme Networks. Credit all photos: Boston Red Sox

\ \  BY PAUL KAPUSTKA

As the oldest stadium in major league

baseball, the Boston Red Sox’s Fenway
Park is a beloved icon, especially for
its architectural quirks like the “Green

Monster” wall in left field. While endearing and
intriguing, those same construction elements --
some dating back to the park’s opening in 1912 -- also
make it extremely challenging to deploy modern
wireless technology.

Recently we talked to Randy George, vice president
of technology operations for the Boston Red Sox,
about how the team overcame those construction
and aesthetic challenges to provide fans with a
cutting-edge Wi-Fi 6 network using gear from
Extreme Networks that enables the connectivity
experience fans now expect everywhere they go.

While Boston’s beloved ballpark has actually been
a proponent of in-stadium Wi-Fi for a long time
-- according to George, some of the initial network
deployments started as early as 2004 -- for multiple
reasons the stadium has never been able to deploy
a true state-of-the-art, full-ballpark coverage
network, until now.

Finally, after technical innovations and some internal
arm-twisting, George and his team now have a
network they can be proud of, both now and into the
foreseeable future.

“I’m happy that for our customers and employees,
Wi-Fi is not a pain point anymore,” George said.
“It’s been a long time since we were able to actively
promote it.”

THE PROBLEMS OF PUTTING TECHNOLOGY INTO A
HISTORICAL SPOT

As the oldest active big-league baseball stadium,
Fenway Park doesn’t need an introduction and
probably doesn’t need much help to be one of those

places that is on just about every fan’s bucket list
for a visit. From the famed Green Monster wall in left
field to the short foul pole in right field, the place just
oozes baseball history, with quirks and charms that are
abundantly evident even during TV broadcasts.

But what happens when you want to update a building
with parts dating back to its opening in 1912 with new
technology? Especially wireless technology, which
requires things like conduit pipes and antennas that
aren’t a clean fit with older architecture?

“It is an interesting place to manage technology in,”
said George, who has been facing that challenge now
for 21 years with the team. “We need to be very careful
where we place technology, relative to the original
structures,” he added.

According to George at one point the Red Sox had to
answer about any construction in the park to three
different regulatory bodies, including the Boston
Landmarks Commission, a Massachussetts historic
commission and even the National Parks, creating

28    STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   FALL 2022

documentation to get approval for any changes. While
George said that lately the process has become easier,
the regulations still exist.

“There are things in the park like steelwork that we
have to stay away from,” George said. “But we’ve
become pretty good at working around those hurdles.”

BEATING THE COVID SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES

After some playoff events a few years ago stressed
the park’s wireless capabilities, George said the
Red Sox looked in earnest at upgrading the Wi-Fi
network. According to George the team was already
working with Extreme Networks on the deployment
when in February of 2021, Extreme announced that
it would become the Wi-Fi supplier to Major League
Baseball’s technology consortium, which assists MLB
parks with the costs of wireless and other technology
installations.

“We had talked to the Patriots about what Extreme had
done for them [at Gillette Stadium], and were already
planning to engage with Extreme prior to the MLB
announcement,” George said. That early move became
important when supply chain issues hit the entire
world after the Covid pandemic hit. While some of the
ballparks that were scheduled to get Extreme Wi-Fi
networks last year had their deployments delayed,
Boston was able to get its new network finished on
time for opening day in 2022.

“We were fortunate to have
started pre-Covid, ahead of
the crazy supply chain issues
other clubs have been dealing
with,” George said.

FINALLY GOING UNDER SEAT IN THE BLEACHERS

George said that Extreme’s purpose-designed
enclosures for stadiums, especially its under-seat
models, helped the Red Sox IT team win an internal
battle they’d been fighting over the years.

According to George, several earlier proposals to put
under-seat enclosures in the outfield bleacher seating
areas had been “shot down” by other people in the
organization, for aesthetic and other reasons. But
with the MLB consortium backing providing monetary
resources and the Extreme gear providing a good look,
George said the IT team finally got to install under-seat
APs in the bleachers.

Overhangs and beams provided other mounting spots for APs covering the main seating bowl

Top: Fenway Park’s architectural quirks and historical importance have historically provided a challenge to bringing wireless technology
into the stadium; Bottom: A center field under-seat enclosure and a lost golf ball

“We just have no overhead assets to get signals close
to the fans out there,” George said. But the combination
of being able to deliver good
service in a way that everyone
could live with won the day.

“The Extreme gear is good-
looking, as far as under-seat
enclosures go,” George said.
“They deserve a lot of credit
for bringing to the plate a form
factor we could digest and get
begrudingly approved.”

George, who tested the service in
the bleachers, called the deployment of the 65 under-
seat APs a game changer.

“It was the first time I was able to sit out there and have
really good service,” he said.

For the rest of the stadium,
especially from foul pole to foul
pole in the main seating bowl,
George said under-seat wasn’t an
option mainly due to the age of the
structures, including some parts
that had been built for the original
opening in 1912. But with good
overhang access as well as the
ability to put APs into the field wall
pointing backwards, the Red Sox

were able to bring full Wi-Fi 6 coverage to the entire
seating area.

CONNECTIVITY
OUTLOOK SURVEY
RESULTS ARE IN!

What is the top concern of
venues this year? According
to the results of our annual
Stadium Connectivity
Outlook survey, finding
enough people to help
staff the return of capacity
crowds to venues was top
of mind among the stadium
technology professionals who
participated in our survey.

In a partnership with sponsor Verizon, in August and September of this year we reached out to the Stadium
Tech Report audience and asked them to participate in our second Stadium Connectivity Outlook survey,
which asked a wide range of questions about the current state of a venue’s connectivity, and where the
venues, teams and schools would prioritize investments and strategies. Their answers are now available for
you to read, in both a survey results format and an accompanying white paper that summarizes the data.

Presented by Stadium Tech Report and

Optical scanners for concessions checkout (left) and ticket scanning (right) are another part of
the enhanced technology now found inside Fenway Park

In total, the new network has approximately 597
Extreme Wi-Fi 6 APs, which includes not just the
stadium but also coverage of the new 5,000-seat MGM
Music Hall venue that opened during the summer, just
outside the Fenway Park walls. According to stats
provided by the Red Sox, the network saw a peak
unique client count of 23,412 users on opening day.

Another benefit of a fully functional Wi-Fi network
is its ability to offload celluar customers to take
pressure off the stadium’s DAS. According to the Red
Sox there were 14,980 Verizon subscribers who were
automatically authenticated on opening day, along
with almost 4,000 T-Mobile subscribers (offload is not
available for AT&T customers). According to George,
Verizon is currently deploying a new 5G cellular network
inside the park that is scheduled to be ready for
opening day in 2023.

LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE

Like other ballparks, Fenway Park is steeling itself for
a future that may include some kind of sportsbook

facility either in or around the stadium. George
also mentioned that the formerly sleepy ballpark
neighborhood is now a hub of activity, with new
residential and commercial buildings starting to rise.
The team’s goal is to ensure that fans in and around the
stadium have a single good method of connectivity,
so for George the network planning doesn’t end at the
outfield walls anymore.

“It’s interesting to watch the stats on usage now, to
see what people are doing while they’re at the game,”
George said. “But what’s really great is to see things like
20,000 users on the Wi-Fi and the environment doesn’t
skip a beat.”
