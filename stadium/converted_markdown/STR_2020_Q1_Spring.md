THE FANS
WILL RETURN

BY PAUL KAPUSTKA

U.S. BANK STADIUM DURING THE 2019 FINAL FOUR.

A s  Mobile  Sports  Report  was  putting

the  final  touches  on  this  issue  of
our  Stadium  Tech  Report  the  sports
world  had  a  week  that  truly  rede-
fined the word “unprecedented.” The
cancellation of the NCAA’s men’s and
women’s basketball tournaments, which came after the
NBA’s decision to suspend its season after a player test-
ed positive for coronavirus, was quickly followed by the
cancellation of every live sporting event out there. That’s
a gut punch sports had never seen before.

  Make no mistake: Everyone in sports, as disappoint-
ed as they may be, understands the rationale for the sus-
pensions and cancellations. These are not normal times,
and the spread of the coronavirus must be stopped be-
fore it wreaks any more havoc than it has already done.
Lives everywhere are in danger, and if not holding some
sports  events  makes  us  all  safer,  it  is  not  just  a  wise
choice but the only choice. There is no other side of the
discussion.

  Originally,  I  had  slated  a  picture  of  a  game  being
played in an empty stadium for this page, but eventually
decided against that as we don’t really need any more
reminders of the world we are all going to experience
for the near-term future. As of this writing, it’s fair to say
that nobody anywhere has any idea how long we will
need to abstain from large public gatherings. But for the

safety of all of us it is a necessary evil, and one that in
the end – compared to the rest of the challenges raised
by the virus – are among the easiest to endure.

  Yes,  there  will  be  pain.  Mainly  it  will  be  felt  not
just by the athletes, but also by those who rely on full
stadiums as a means of employment. Within days, oth-
er owners, players and teams followed the lead set by
Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, who was already
assembling plans to pay stadium workers who are fac-
ing  an  undetermined  span  of  no  income.  Beyond  the
headaches of scheduling and determining how to move
sports forward, there will likely be other pains we don’t
even know how to guess about yet. But I am confident
that at some point, the fans will return.

And when they do, there will be a renewed joy in
the  tribal  pleasure  of  assembling  together,  to  celebrate
sports,  a  good  show,  and  the  camaraderie  that  makes
live events so much more fulfilling than “sitting on the
couch.”  For  people  in  our  industry,  the  downtime  can
perhaps  be  used  for  all  kinds  of  work  that  you  can’t
easily do when stadiums and arenas are filled up on a
regular  basis;  because  when  the  fans  come  back,  they
are going to want even more than ever to share that ex-
perience as much as they can. Let’s make sure we’re all
ready to go when the lights come back on again.

And that’s when, not if. –MSR–

Small IT budget?
Don’t ignore
the DIY option

BY PAUL KAPUSTKA

Here  at  Mobile  Sports  Report,  we’ve

made  a  habit  of  trying  to  report  and
write about the biggest networks, the
bleeding-edge  uses  of  technology,
the  venues  pushing  the  envelope  on
what’s possible. If you follow us here
and online, it’s no secret that we like writing about the
biggest  Wi-Fi  days,  the  most  cellular  traffic  used,  and
how  venues  handle  the  biggest  events,  like  the  Super
Bowl and the Final Four.

  Now  watch  us  also  go  in  the  other  direction.  Our
lineup can play small ball, too.

  Why? Mainly while because we believe that covering
the biggest events and leading users of technology still
matters a lot – it shows us all what is possible and where
the future is going – we are also realizing that it’s time to
fill in the gaps below the best of the best, and write some
more about networking and technology for all the rest.

  We realize, for example, that this issue’s cover sto-
ry subject, Dickies Arena, is a once-in-a-lifetime kind of
deal that may not be replicated anywhere else, anytime
soon.  Same  for  our  recent  coverage  of  technology  de-
ployments at Chase Center, the new home of the Golden
State Warriors in San Francisco. The budgets, expertise
and direction necessary to deploy the kind of advanced
installations found at those venues are at a level that few
in the industry will ever be able to achieve.

B ut take a look at another story in this

issue,  the  profile  of  Rutgers  Univer-
sity’s  ingenious,  do-it-yourself  ap-
proach to bringing Wi-Fi to the cam-
pus  basketball  arena.  For  the  total
of about $62,000 and a lot of elbow
grease, the Rutgers IT team was able to deliver a solution
that fit their school’s needs – good, basic connectivity in
a place where there was none. Like many other schools
(and  probably  even  some  smaller  professional  teams)
Rutgers had lots of commercial bids to help them bring
Wi-Fi  in,  but  the  price  was  always  way  too  steep.  But
instead of just shrugging their shoulders, Rutgers exper-
imented, learned things on the way, and eventually got
the job done.

It’s a great story for any team, school or venue who’s
sitting on the fence about whether or not they can afford
to bring connectivity to their building. And it’s the kind
of story we want to tell more of, going forward.

‘Pop-up networks’ can fill the gaps

The  Rutgers  story  was  just  one  of  the  things  we
learned  while  being  a  “fly  on  the  wall”  at  this  year’s
College IT peer conference, hosted in early February at
the University of Michigan. Tops on our list of learning
was that while we speak to college IT folks mostly about

the big picture of stadium wireless and technology de-
ployments,  their  “regular  working  days”  are  filled  with
lots of other must-do tasks, which include mundane but
necessary items like onboarding and offboarding athletic
department employees, running scorekeeping and other
event systems at a wide variety of events (with gymnas-
tics being the runaway pain point due to the intracacies
of  keeping  score  across  multiple  events)  and  trying  to
keep order among a very empowered group of core us-
ers (meaning coaches).

If you want to hear a good story about how to bring
a wireless network to a cross-country finish line in the
middle of a field, hit up Virginia Tech’s Tommy Regan
the next time you see him and ask him about the spare
coils of optical fiber he uses for what he calls “pop-up
networks.” We also heard from other school representa-
tives who related small-success stories about using Cra-
dlepoint cellular modems to bring connectivity to hard-
to-reach places where even just a minimum bandwidth
of internet meant a lot of utility.

  One story we’re hoping to tell in the near future is
about  a  low-cost  app  development  platform  that  Dan
FitzSimmons  from  Indiana  University  used  to  create  a
gameday staff instructions app – an app that was easily

repurposed for use when Indiana went to a bowl game.
Again, it’s not a hot/sexy topic like building an app for
concessions delivery to fans, but the great and obvious
utility of having a easily customizable app for staff op-
erations  that  costs  a  couple  thousand  dollars  (for  the
license) and just some DIY time sounds like a story our
audience would find very interesting.

And according to the Rutgers team, by having to re-
ally get their own hands dirty, they felt they learned a lot
more about Wi-Fi networking than they would have by
just overseeing a contractor or a consultant, or by going
to a class or a conference. Do you have a similar story to
tell? Let us know – just reach out via email to me at kaps

story that your peers may find of great use. –MSR–

DICKIES
ARENA

PUSHES ARENA EXPERIENCE
TO NEW HEIGHTS

BY PAUL KAPUSTKA

DICKIES ARENA
EXPERIENCE

W ithout  a  professional  or  major

college  sports  team  as  a  main
tenant, it’s somewhat of a wonder
that Dickies Arena in Fort Worth,
Texas,  got  built  at  all.  But  once
you  step  inside  and  attend  an
event  there,  the  wonder  shifts  to  the  sheer  excellence
that surrounds you, in what may be simply the best-built
arena-sized venue, anywhere.

It might seem like a Texas-sized stretch to make such
a  claim,  but  any  other  basketball-sized  stadium  similar
to  14,000-seat  Dickies  Arena  would  be  hard  pressed
to  top  the  amenities,  infrastructure  and  operations
installed inside the new gem of Fort Worth. While first
and  foremost  the  venue  serves  as  home  of  the  annual
Fort  Worth  Stock  Show  &  Rodeo,  a  three-week-plus
extravaganza that held its maiden run there earlier this
year,  Dickies  Arena  will  also  host  concerts,  ice  shows
and other sporting and non-sporting events, saving local
folks from having to drive east to Dallas for a big-time
experience.

But it’s opulence, comfort and service that will be the
hallmarks of a Dickies Arena experience going forward,
with those attributes far outweighing the convenience of

just having a world-class venue in Fort Worth. During a
visit by Mobile Sports Report during the middle of this
year’s rodeo program (which ran 23 straight days from
Jan. 17 to Feb. 8) we saw not just the visible attributes of
perhaps the most polished finish of any arena ever, but
also the underpinnings of important infrastructure assets
like the wireless networks and video operations, and the
intense level of attention to detail in food and beverage
operations, all aimed at raising the fan experience to the
highest level.

The opera house meets the rodeo
  When we last visited the under-construction Dickies
Arena in the fall of 2019, the finishing touches weren’t in
place yet, even though we could see hints of what it was
shaping  up  to  be.  For  our  late-January  visit  for  a  night
of  rodeo,  we  got  to  see  the  finished  product  in  all  its
glory, and all we can say is, it may be some time before
another  venue  even  approaches  the  level  of  cosmetic
finish achieved at Dickies Arena.

To  be  sure,  not  many  venue  ownerships  may  have
the  financial  resources  or  the  certainty  of  what  they
want out of a finished product as the team behind the
creation  of  Fort  Worth’s  newest  centerpiece.  If  you’re
not  familiar  with  the  Dickies  Arena  story,  the  arena  is
part of a public-private venture between the city of Fort
Worth and a consortium of investors and donors led by
local Fort Worth philanthropist Ed Bass. As the home of

Fort  Worth’s  namesake  rodeo,  Dickies  Arena  is  clearly
meant to be that and so much more, cementing in place
a building where people who know what they want got
exactly what they wanted – and more.

  While we didn’t get to speak with Bass directly, his
presence  is  felt  in  all  areas  of  operation  of  the  facility,
with multiple stories of his direct involvement in making
sure the smallest of details were adhered to. Even a first-
time visitor to the rodeo could see and feel the devotion
of leaders like Bass to their signature hometown event,
from his riding a horse at the front of the event-opening
parade  to  his  video-board  cameos  of  slapping  bundles
of cash into the hands of the event winners as the night
progressed.

Behind  the  scenes,  we  heard  stories

about  how  Bass  and  the  leadership
team  wanted  very  specific  things
done cosmetically – like making sure
that  no  antennas  for  either  the  Wi-
Fi  or  DAS  networks  were  visible  in
any  of  the  main  public  areas.  To  meet  that  challenge,
main  technical  integrator  AmpThink  had  to  go  outside
the  norm  to  design  (and  in  some  cases,  custom-build)
enclosures to hide the gear. Walking through the main
concourses and seating areas, the only hint that wireless
equipment might be overhead was the outline of flush-
mounted panels, a design theme that even carried out to

outside-wall  mounting  areas  in  the  plaza  areas  around
the arena’s exteriors.

  Once  inside  Dickies  Arena,  visitors  may  feel  like
they are in somewhere more like an opera house than a
multi-purpose venue (which on this night had a “playing
floor”  of  some  finely  raked  dirt).  Floors  of  decorative
tiles are underfoot, and railings on the staircases enclose
sculptures  of  a  distinctive  local  grass  plant.  That  same
design  is  reflected  on  the  plates  used  in  one  of  the
premium seating areas, where the dining choices include
a sit-down, white-tablecloth experience that looks like a
four-star steakhouse inserted into the concourse.

Bill Shaw, the assistant general manager for Dickies
Arena, was courteous enough to give us a directed tour
of  the  venue  before  the  night’s  activities,  pointing  out
things we might have noticed but not really realized, like
the different tones and types of wood used for paneling,
which  changed  as  you  moved  from  a  higher  premium
seating area to a more general admission space. In the
suites,  Shaw  showed  us  some  especially  comfy  leather
stadium chairs, which he said were the end result of a
long process of determination to find out the best way to
pad and tan the chair’s components.

Even the construction of the wheeled chairs in the
loge box where we were the guest of AmpThink for the
night were subject to scrutiny by Mr. Bass, we were told,
with  a  story  about  him  using  tape  measures  to  ensure
the seat width was correct, and discussions about having
the proper types of armrests that wouldn’t inadvertently
snag the handles of a handbag.

“Mr.  Bass  spent  a  lot  of  time  on  all  of  that,”  said

Shaw. “His fingerprints are everywhere.”

To  be  sure,  the  somewhat  unique  ownership
structure  and  the  recurring  revenue  from  the  rodeo  –
which  has  sold-out  status  for  all  the  premium  seating
spaces thanks to the families who have been supporting
the  event  for  generations  –  means  in  part  that  Dickies
Arena  doesn’t  have  to  saturate  its  public  spaces  with
advertising.  While  its  digital  display  arsenal  includes
striking  elements  like  curved  LED  screens  from  LG
and menu boards and other displays running the Cisco
Vision dynamic signage system, Dickies Arena only has
a small number of partner-sponsors whose messages run
somewhat discreetly compared to other arenas that may
have more need to have a higher number of displays and
advertisements.

The  layout  of  the  arena  in  general  also  takes  its
cue  from  how  the  premium  seating  space  is  used  for
the rodeo. Instead of a normal sort of top-down arena
seating  with  “courtside”  seats  being  the  most  desired,
the wide space needed for rodeo events and the family
atmosphere (most premium packages, according to Shaw,
are bought by families and not corporations) means that
there are “boxes” of seats ringing the lower bowl, with a
wide walkway behind them to facilitate the meeting and
greeting (and the seeing and being-seen) that is part of the
rodeo culture. Thanks to some very clever architecture
and movable stands technology, the mid-bowl walkway
can disappear for events like concerts and other sporting
situations like basketball; but good luck trying to figure
out how that works by walking by the stands, since all
the moving parts are, of course, hidden from view.

  While  a  ring  of  suites  provides  another  premium
seating  option  a  bit  higher  up,  at  either  end  of  the
venue are two more unique gathering areas, with belly-
up bars that stretch almost the full width of the space,
providing  a  place  for  the  premium  box-seat  patrons  to
mingle while still having a clear view of whatever action
is taking place. Shaw noted that at one end of the arena
the  seating  can  collapse  back  to  almost  a  straight  line,
providing ample space for concert stages that also gives
Dickies  Arena  a  concert-seating  total  that  Shaw  said  is
comparable to American Airlines Center in Dallas, which
seats 20,000 for NBA and NHL games.

Then  there  are  some  more  touches  you  can’t  see,
like  the  bass-sound  traps  installed  in  the  roof  area  to
improve  acoustics  –  and  those  you  can  see,  like  the
soaring rooftop that is meant to mimic the open sky of
Texas.  As  more  fans  attend  different  events  scheduled
in  the  future,  including  gymnastic  meets,  concerts,  ice
shows and NCAA regional basketball tournament games,
they  are  no  doubt  going  to  be  impressed  and  perhaps
surprised by the “opera house” where boots and Stetsons
are the local fashion of choice.

Well wired for wireless

In our early fall visit to Dickies Arena we detailed the
single, converged fiber network that supports all network
operations,  including  the  cellular  DAS,  the  arena  Wi-Fi
and  the  IPTV  operations,  in  an  orderly,  future-proofed
way.

Built  by  AmpThink  for  the  arena,  the  network
is  a  departure  from  what  has  long  been  the  norm  in
venue IT deployments, where multiple service providers
typically build their own networks, with multiple cabling
systems competing for conduit space. At Dickies Arena,
AmpThink was able to control the fiber systems to follow
a  single,  specific  path,  allowing  the  company  to  save
costs and space for the client while building out a system
with  enough  extra  capacity  to  handle  future  needs  for
bandwidth, according to AmpThink.

According to AmpThink president Bill Anderson, one
of  those  future  needs  became  necessary  this  past  fall,
when  Verizon  wanted  to  bring  its  5G  millimeter-wave
services as a late addition to the arena. To support the four
5G antennas that are now mounted up in the catwalk,
Anderson said AmpThink was able to just allocate some
of the spare optical fiber it has in place throughout the
building, making it possible to bring in the service “in a
very affordable way.”

In addition to the numerous custom enclosures used
throughout  the  venue,  Anderson  said  AmpThink  also
designed  a  pre-fabricated  combination  Wi-Fi  and  DAS
antenna unit design that it could then hoist up into the
rafters in a single pull. By having the green light to lead
and innovate, AmpThink was able to develop and learn
things  it  will  draw  on  well  into  the  future,  Anderson
said. “This is really our master class [on stadium network
design],” Anderson said.

Since we spent most of our January time

at  the  venue  touring  the  spaces  and
talking  to  different  representatives,  we
didn’t have that much time for network
speed  tests  but  the  ones  we  did  get
showed the typical strong performances
of an AmpThink-built network. On one of the concourses
behind the suite levels we got a Wi-Fi speedtest of 67.0
Mbps on the download side and 65.0 Mbps on the upload.

16        STADIUM TECH REPORT SPRING 2020

Up at the highest level of seating, which is served from
the rafter-mounted APs, we got a speedtest of 28.3 Mbps
/ 39.5 Mbps, during the night’s final event.

to  Anderson

Though  we  didn’t  get  down  there  for  a  speedtest,
the  lower-bowl  seats  are  served  by  under-seat  Wi-
there  are
Fi  enclosures.  According
approximately 550 Cisco Wi-Fi APs used throughout the
venue, all of which are now the latest versions supporting
the new Wi-Fi 6 standard. The DAS, which is overseen by
ExteNet Systems, uses the Corning ONE DAS hardware
system  with  approximately  258  active  antennas  in  11
zones for the DAS.

Keeping video and food and beverage
operations in-house
  Having  never  been  to  a  live  rodeo  event  before,
Mobile  Sports  Report  was  somewhat  in  awe  of  the
video production inside the arena, with multiple camera
angles repeatedly in use on the large-screen centerhung
videoboard.  With  no  pauses,  halftimes  or  timeouts,
action was constant, and reflected as such on the main
video screens.

  We are simply going to have to revisit the arena for
a  more  in-depth  exploration  of  the  video  production
operation  itself,  which  is  run  entirely  by  the  Dickies
Arena team and even provides live feeds itself to cable
channels  covering  rodeo.  One  of  the  more  innovative

twists inside the building is a concourse-level fan booth,
where  a  large  interactive  video  board  can  serve  up
multiple instant replays of rodeo action by clicking and
dragging screenshots to the main display area.

The three-plus weeks of back to back rodeo action was
somewhat of a stress test for the video crew, since almost
every  night  there  were  different  types  of  competitions
(for  instance,  the  night  we  attended  there  was  a  team
competition, with scores from multiple events tabulated
into  a  final  team  score)  requiring  custom  programs  to
populate  the  video  board  displays.  According  to  the
video  team  there  were  no  fewer  than  seven  different
scoring programs in play each night, but they were able
to coordinate the results so quickly that they actually had
to introduce a time delay into the reporting from judges
to the video screens, so that the announcers could add
some drama to their live play-by-play.

  On  the  food  and  beverage  side  of  operations,  the
do-it-ourselves  theory  of  Dickies  Arena  meant  that  the
arena controls all aspects of F&B operations, instead of
contracting much of the work to a third-party caterer.

Julie  Margolin,  director  of  food  and  beverage
operations  at  Dickies  Arena,  said  it  starts  with  little
things, like not having to live with a certain brand of hot
dog because that is the brand a caterer carries. But then
it expands into what is possible, and why you would try
to do things like provide in-seat delivery service to 4,000
premium seats while also balancing the F&B needs for
a diverse operation that includes white-tablecloth dining,
suite operations, high-end bar areas, and mobile point-
of-sale to support cotton-candy sales on the concourses.

“We  do  everything  we  can  to  make  sure  every
experience is the best,” said Margolin. “That’s a task not
a lot of people are willing to take on.”

But  Margolin,  who  previously  held  a  similar  title
at  the  Honda  Center  in  Los  Angeles,  is  like  other  top
performers  who  found  the  opportunity  and  challenge
presented by Dickies Arena too good to pass up.

“This  building  is  very  different  than  others  in  the
industry,”  said  Margolin,  citing  the  close  working
atmosphere  that  rapidly  built  between  operations  and
construction  and  information  technology  teams  as  the
building opened late in 2019 ahead of the real debut, the
rodeo season.

“If  something  needed  fixing,  nobody  went  home
until it was done,” Margolin said. And while like others
she’s always looking for ways to improve, Margolin said
the whole idea of a venue owning and operating its own
F&B was an exciting challenge.

“If  you  go  with  someone  else’s  [catering]  model,
you’re  serving  two  masters,”  Margolin  said.  But  trying
to  meld  numerous  different  types  of  fan  experience
operations, she said, is a challenge worth pursuing.

“If  you  stick  with  the  status  quo,  you’re  going

backwards,” she said.

Dickies Arena: As good as it gets?

Standing outside the arena on a clear-sky night, from
one  of  the  outdoor  plazas,  fans  have  a  pleasing  view
back  toward  the  lighted  buildings  of  downtown  Fort
Worth.  Legend  has  it  that  Ed  Bass  purchased  the  land
Dickies Arena sits on more than three decades ago, with
the vision that someday he would help build an arena
with that signature view back toward downtown. Now
that  that  dream  is  reality,  the  sky’s  the  limit  for  what
Dickies Arena future may be.

Though the coronavirus has effectively put all arena
schedules  somewhat  on  hold,  prior  to  the  outbreak
Dickies Arena had already announced future bookings
for  big-name  concert  acts  as  well  as  family  events
like  Disney  on  Ice,  Cirque  du  Soleil  and  even  the  U.S.
Gymnastics  Championships.  Clearly,  the  events  market
will  make  use  of  a  venue  of  Dickies  Arena’s  size  and
stature.

According to Shaw, patrons with rodeo season tickets
get  first  dibs  on  other  events,  but  it’s  a  good  bet  that
the  diversity  of  action  inside  the  Dickies  Arena  walls
will  mean  that  a  wide  number  of  fans  will  be  able  to
experience the wide range of seating options available.
But even those attending on the least-expensive tickets
will still be able to experience the overall quality of all
aspects of the arena, which will be hard for other venues
to match. –MSR–

RECORD WI-FI AT SUPER BOWL
FUELED BY HUGE INCREASE
IN BANDWITH PER USER

RECORD WI-FI USE
AT SUPER BOWL

statistics from every Super Bowl, was also the gear pro-
vider  for  the  network  at  Hard  Rock  Stadium,  the  first
Super  Bowl  for  Extreme  gear  since  Super  Bowl  51  at
Houston’s NRG Stadium back in 2017. According to Ex-
treme, the Wi-Fi setup at Hard Rock Stadium uses some
2,000  APs,  many  of  which  are  deployed  in  under-seat
enclosures in the bowl seating.

The average data used per device, Brams said, is to
Extreme the proof of how well each user is served by the
network, and is perhaps a more important metric than
the simple total of data used.

“If you are asking what is the health of a network,
the  average  [data  used]  per  user  is  a  good  metric  for
that,” Brams said. Brams, like MSR, also believes that the
average data used per user is a metric that can be used to
compare network performances between different-sized
stadiums,  like  football  stadiums  and  basketball  arenas,
which might be very far apart in total data used simply
because of the capacity differences.

Verizon autoconnect helps out on the
Wi-Fi usage
  With a reported 44,358 unique devices connected to
the network this year’s Super Bowl also set a new mark
for Super Bowl take rate at 71 percent; the top overall
take rate mark still belongs to Ohio State, which saw 71.5
percent  of  its  fans  connected  when  Ohio  Stadium  saw
25.6 TB of Wi-Fi used this past fall during a game against

T he  big  game  is  back  on  top  of  the

unofficial  Mobile  Sports  Report  sin-
gle-day Wi-Fi rankings, with a mark
of  26.42  terabytes  of  data  used  at
Super Bowl LIV in Miami, according
to figures reported by Extreme Net-
works.

  What’s most interesting (to us) about the number is
that it was generated in a venue that had approximate-
ly  8,000  fewer  fans  in  attendance  than  last  year’s  Su-
per Bowl (70,081 in Atlanta for Super Bowl 53 vs. 62,417
for Super Bowl 54). It was also the second-lowest Super
Bowl attendance figure ever, just above the 61,946 fans
who attended Super Bowl 1.

So  not  surprisingly  the  fans  who  connected  to  the
Wi-Fi network at Miami’s Hard Rock Stadium also set a
new  record  for  average  data  consumed  per  connected
user,  at  595.6  megabytes  per  user  —  a  big  jump  from
last year’s average data per user total of 492.3 MB. Going
forward, we here at MSR think this statistic is even more
important  than  the  overall  data-used  or  total  tonnage
mark, since it more accurately reflects how the network
is performing for fans.

“I think the average [data] per user is the metric we’re
most proud of,” said John Brams, director of sports and
entertainment  for  Extreme  Networks.  Extreme,  which
has a sponsorship deal with the NFL to provide network

Michigan  State.  It’s  worth  noting  that  the  average  data
per user mark from the Ohio State game was 341.6 MB.

Like at Ohio State, at Hard Rock Stadium fans whose
devices were on a Verizon cellular subscription could be
automatically  connected  to  the  Wi-Fi  network,  a  factor
that  often  results  in  high  take  rates.  Verizon  has  sim-
ilar  deals  with  a  number  of  NFL  stadiums  and  some
large  college  venues,  including  Ohio  State,  Florida  and
Brigham Young. Verizon would not reveal what percent-
age of its customers were included in the overall unique
Wi-Fi connection number at Super Bowl LIV.

Peak network usage hits 10 Gbps

Some more info from the great list put together by
Extreme:  The  peak  concurrent  user  number  of  24,837
devices  was  seen  during  pre-game  activities;  the  peak
network throughput of 10.4 Gbps also occurred before
the game started, according to Extreme. Of the final data
total, 11.1 TB was used before the game started, with the
balance of 15.32 TB being used after kickoff.

“We’ve  seen  the  highest  data  rates  right  before  the
game started at the last four Super Bowls,” said Brams.
According to Brams, this statistic may be caused by the

24        STADIUM TECH REPORT SPRING 2020

fact that people at Super Bowls tend to arrive very early
for the games, and by the NFL’s attempts to keep things
interesting with plenty of pregame entertainment.

The most used streaming apps by fans at Super Bowl
LIV were, in order of usage, Apple iTunes, Apple Stream-
ing, YouTube, Spotify and Netflix; the most used social
apps in order of usage were Facebook, Instagram, Twit-
ter, Snapchat and Bitmoji. For sports apps, the most used
in order of usage were ESPN, NFL, NFL OnePass, CBS
Sports and ESPN Go.

  When  reading  through  the  list  of  apps,  MSR  won-
dered out loud who would be watching Netflix at a Su-
per Bowl. But Brams thinks Extreme’s network statistics
have an answer.

“It’s amazing how many people bring kids to a big
game,” he said. “And those kids may not be that inter-
ested in everything going on at the game, so in between
they  are  streaming  shows  [on  Netflix].”  Brams  said  the
Netflix-at-games is a trend at NFL games in general, with
Netflix consistently showing up in the top 5 of apps used
on a stadium network. –MSR–

might even be more important is the confidence and ex-
perience gained by the IT team by rolling up its sleeves
and finding a way to deliver the network at a very reason-
able price.

“The practical experience of doing this ourselves was
just so much more interesting than attending conferences
or  networking  classes,”  said  Jonathan  Beal,  systems  ad-
ministrator for the Rutgers athletics IT team. “I’d encour-
age smaller schools to look into something like this.”

Turnkey system prices ‘out of range’

Though Rutgers isn’t exactly small (enrollment is just
more  than  50,000  at  the  main  campus  in  New  Bruns-
wick, N.J.) and while its teams are part of the major Big
Ten conference, the school simply doesn’t have the athlet-
ic-department budgets that some of its conference breth-
ren do. And while Beal said that the school is regularly
approached  by  technology  vendors  with  stadium  Wi-Fi
pitches, the million-dollar-plus price tags for deployments
are a non-starter for Rutgers.

“We  get  approached  year  after  year,  but  the  quotes
are always out of our [budget] range,” Beal said. But at the
college IT conference in 2019, Beal said the Rutgers team
was interested in a presentation from the IT department
at the University of Virginia, where that school used low-

STADIUM TECH REPORT   SPRING 2020     27

It was a bit more complicated than a trip to Home

Depot, but when the Rutgers University IT team
wanted  to  bring  fan-facing  Wi-Fi  to  the  school’s
basketball arena but didn’t have the budget for a
big-name  contractor  or  vendor  deal,  it  did  what
many weekend warriors do when faced with the
same build vs. buy decision:

They did it themselves.

By  purchasing  lower-cost  Wi-Fi  gear  and  doing  al-
most  all  of  the  design  and  deployment  work  in-house,
the Rutgers IT team was able to bring a satisfactory level
of coverage to the 8,000-seat Rutgers Athletic Center for
a  total  price  tag  of  about  $62,000,  according  to  repre-
sentatives from the school’s athletic IT department. The
Rutgers  team  first  told  their  story  at  this  year’s  College
Athletics IT peer conference in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and
then provided more details in a follow-up interview with
Mobile Sports Report.

The  success  of  the  DIY  Wi-Fi  deployment  now  has
the Rutgers IT team looking at a similar method for bring-
ing Wi-Fi to the school’s football stadium, starting with a
localized deployment in the student section where it an-
ticipates needs will be the highest. While fans at events in
the “RAC” are probably happy for the connectivity, what

er-cost  equipment  from  Wi-Fi  gear  provider  Ubiquiti  to
bring Wi-Fi to Virginia’s football stadium.

“It  was  an  easier  sell  than  we  thought,”  said  Beal.

“They [the administration] trusted us.”

  While Beal said the Virginia team detailed some ini-
tial failures in their deployment program, eventually they
got  it  on  track,  and  inspired  the  Rutgers  crew  to  see  if
they could chart a similar path.

“We took notes, came back to New Jersey, made some
phone calls, and asked ‘how far could we go?’,” Beal said.
At the beginning, the team guessed they might be able to
get the school to “absorb the cost” of a test deployment ei-
ther in the basketball arena or the football stadium. What
tipped the project in the basketball arena’s favor was the
existence of some recently installed conduits leading to
the  rafters,  where  some  biometric  tracking  equipment
and some previous DAS gear had been installed.

“For the football stadium, the [conduit] pathways are
challenging  –  it’s  going  to  be  costly  when  we  do  that,”
Beal said.

After trying out a few test APs sent over by Ubiquiti
the  Rutgers  team  felt  confident  in  their  choice  of  hard-
ware, and submitted a budget for $60,000 – which was
quickly approved.

Overhead vs. under seat

Choosing  to  put  Wi-Fi  in  the  rafters  pointing  down
instead of under the seats pointing up was another con-
scious choice Rutgers made after noticing a difference be-
tween how football fans and basketball fans use in-venue
wireless.

“We  noticed  that  at  football  games  fans  download
[data]  and  watch  stuff,  then  go  back  to  watching  the
game,”  Beal  said.  “For  basketball  it’s  a  totally  different
user  experience.  People  aren’t  watching  things  on  their
phones, but they are uploading to Instagram.”

So instead of solving for density and coverage (where
under-seat offers a generally better experience) the Rut-
gers team aimed for the best upload experience for the
money – which meant they could do top-down APs using
line-of-sight tuning.

  With  a  blend  of  a  3D  rendering  of  the  entire  seat-
ing bowl (done with 360-degree cameras) and some help
from Ekahau survey tools, the Rutgers team pinpointed
the optimal placement points for the APs in the rafters.
Since the seating in “The RAC” is mostly only on the two

sides  of  the  court  –  and  not  behind  the  baskets  –  the
deployment  became  a  fairly  uncomplicated  tale  of  two
halves, with two APs for each sector.

Some tuning revealed a need to tilt the top AP down
from a straight horizontal mount top since the tin roof of
the RAC (which contributes to the venue’s historic reputa-
tion for being loud and an intimidating place to play) also
reflects RF signals.

“Everything bounces around up there off the roof, in-
cluding the RF,” said Beal. With 20 APs in the rafters (and
four  more  down  at  court  level  for  other  areas)  Rutgers
was able to get the kind of coverage they wanted. After
installing the APs with help from campus technicians –
including installing backup chains to keep APs from fall-
ing onto any guests – it was time for the next step: Seeing
what happened when fans joined the network.

Captive portal or free access?

Like almost every other venue that has installed Wi-
Fi for guests, Rutgers struggled with how to make access
available. Should it just be free to use with no restrictions,
or should they try to use some kind of captive portal to
get an email address or other identifying information so
that the school could market to event attendees?

Joe  Vassilatos,  unit  computing  manager  for  the  Rut-
gers  athletics  IT  team,  said  there  was  some  favor  of  a
Facebook  sign-in  method  from  the  Rutgers  marketing
team, because of the ease of identification. But Vassilatos
said the IT team was “wary” of using a Facebook method,
something Beal agreed with.

“We got some feedback from other schools that if you
put that [Facebook sign-in] in, nobody uses the network,”
said Beal.

Instead, the team opted for a sign-in method that uses
a one-time SMS code with a 4-digit number that fans must
enter  to  get  access  to  the  network.  But  both  Beal  and
Vassilatos hoped that in the future there might be other
ways  to  monetize  the  network  –  like  doing  offload  for
cellular carriers – that would allow them to make access
even easier.

  With the network in place during this past basketball
season,  Rutgers  saw  good  numbers  on  the  usage  side,
with anywhere from 600 to 800 people using the network
at games this winter. Beal said network statistics showed

that at most games, 20 percent of the visitors connected

challenge since Rutgers students rarely sit in one place,
but instead crowd the area and even stand on bleachers
trying to cram in.

“That shows they’re a real user, and not just a visitor,”

Beal said.

For  the  last  three  games  of  the  season,  the  Rutgers
network  got  a  promotional  boost  from  a  pregame  light
show that included fans using their mobile devices. Part
of the promotion included instructions to log on to the
Wi-Fi.

But according to Beal, the network wasn’t ever a secret.

“The first thing people do in any place is check for
free Wi-Fi,” Beal said. “And if people are happy with it, it’s
good enough.”

But with a functional Wi-Fi network now inside in-
side the basketball arena, a place known as “The Trape-
zoid of Terror” (for its unique sloped-walls architecture),
the Rutgers IT team is confident of its deployment chops,
and takes great pride in knowing that more events can be
held there with good connectivity, including more poten-
tial money-making events like career fairs and concerts.

“In the past when we had graduation ceremonies or
other events [in the RAC] we had to bring out portable
Wi-Fi,” Beal said. “Now we can take that load on the sta-
dium network.”

For Vassilatos, the Wi-Fi is a reason for a little bit of

chest-beating.

Next steps: Planning for football

For  this  offseason,  the  new  project  for  the  Rutgers
IT  team  is  bringing  Wi-Fi  to  the  student  section  of  the
football stadium, where they are planning to go with an
under-seat approach. According to both Beal and Vassi-
latos deployment there is going to be more of a tuning

“IT  is  usually  very  inward-facing,  and  this  was  our
chance to utilize our skill set to add to the bravado of the
athletic experience,” Vassilatos said. “We took this on our
own to implement, and we’re better from the experience.”

COLORADO’S

T he basketball side of the plan to bring

Wi-Fi and DAS coverage to the Univer-
sity of Colorado’s main athletic facilities
is  complete,  as  both  networks  were
live and operational during the recently
concluded  men’s  and  women’s  hoops
seasons at the CU Events Center.

Coverage for the 11,064-seat facility on the Boulder,
Colo.,  campus  was  built  by  Connectivity  Wireless,  us-
ing Wi-Fi gear from Cisco and the Teko distributed an-
tenna system (DAS) gear from JMA. The deal was first
announced last year, and includes a plan to also bring
both DAS and Wi-Fi to Folsom Field, CU’s football sta-
dium. Originally scheduled to be available for the past
football season, the Folsom Field networks are still under
construction,  with  availability  slated  for  later  this  year,
according to Connectivity Wireless.

The  model  brought  to  CU  is  a  classic  neutral-host
operation,  where  a  provider  like  Connectivity  Wireless
will  build  a  school’s  Wi-Fi  and  DAS  networks  under  a
revenue-sharing deal with the school where the carriers
help some with upfront payments and then provide pay-
ments over a long-term lease to operate on the DAS. The
neutral-host option is one good way for schools or teams
with  smaller  budgets  or  lightly  used  facilities  to  bring
connectivity to arenas.

Solid Wi-Fi performance during a sellout

According  to  Connectivity  Wireless,  the  basketball
arena’s  fan-facing  network  equipment  is  installed  com-
pletely in the catwalks above the court. With a low-hang-
ing  roof  and  a  single-tier  seating  bowl,  the  CU  Events
Center  is  laid  out  somewhat  perfectly  for  the  tradition-
al  top-down  coverage  method,  with  the  distance  close
enough for Wi-Fi equipment.

For Wi-Fi, the final count for APs in the catwalk was
58, and for DAS the final count was 44 antennas in eight
sectors. There is also some additional Wi-Fi in the build-
ing, including a small deployment that is part of the CU
campus network as well as some additional APs Connec-
tivity Wireless deployed to help cover entrance doorways
for mobile-device ticket scanning.

At a Feb. 8 sellout afternoon game against Stanford,

throughout the venue. In our seats in row 23, we got a
pregame Wi-Fi speedtest of 44.9 Mbps on the download
side and 59.2 Mbps on the upload. Roaming around the
bowl  before  tipoff,  we  got  a  speedtest  of  21.2  Mbps  /
45.0 Mbps just behind the student section in the south
end zone seating area. Moving toward midcourt we got a
speedtest of 38.2 Mbps / 35.5 Mbps in row 19 of a corner
section,  and  then  a  top  test  of  63.2  Mbps  /  68.2  Mbps
in the sixth row of a midcourt section, showing that the
closest seats to the action were well covered.

Since only AT&T is active on the DAS, we were not
able to get a speedtest with our Verizon phone. Accord-

ing to Connectivity Wireless, negotiations with Verizon
and T-Mobile are in process to participate on the DAS;
the DAS is also set up to handle Sprint and its 2.5 GHz
spectrum, according to Connectivity Wireless.

Both  the  football  and  basketball  venues’  networks
are served by a central head-end room located in an old
telephone  PBX  space  near  the  center  of  campus.  Fiber
links run from there to both Folsom Field and the Events
Center, through an old system of steam tunnels that used
to  be  the  primary  method  of  bringing  heat  to  campus
buildings. –MSR–
