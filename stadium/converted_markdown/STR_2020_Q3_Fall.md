WHEN YOU SPEND MORE THAN $5 BILLION
BUILDING A REVOLUTIONARY-LOOKING NEW
SPORTS AND ENTERTAINMENT VENUE,
IT’S A GOOD BET THAT THE TECHNOLOGY INSIDE
IS THE BEST THAT CAN BE FOUND.

W hat’s truly innovative at the new

SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles is not
just the quality and functionality
of  the  technology’s  pieces  and
parts,  but  also
the  venue’s
embrace of a converged network
design, where all network-attached devices connect to a
single Cisco Catalyst-based network.

Led  by  Skarpi  Hedinsson,  chief  technology  officer,
SoFi Stadium and Hollywood Park, and master technology
integrator  AmpThink,  the  networking  and  compute
environment  deployed  inside  the  building  (as  well  as
in  Hollywood  Park’s  neighboring  retail,  commercial
and residential area) is unlike most large venues, where
different systems typically exist in their own silos, often
with their own separate and different network.

Instead,  the  SoFi  Stadium  network  brings  all  building
functionality – including the wireless networks (among
the largest built anywhere), the server compute platform,
the  telephone  system,  the  IPTV  network,  the  indoor
and outdoor digital signage (including the massive oval
dual-sided 4K main videoboard), the television broadcast
systems,  and  the  building  management  systems  –  into
one  converged  platform,  with  a  single  vendor/single
format structure.

“What we delivered is a scalable platform that sim-
plifies Day 2 operations on Day 1,” said AmpThink pres-
ident Bill Anderson.

  Over  the  coming  months,  Stadium  Tech  Report
plans to do deep technical dives on each segment of the
stadium’s  different  technology  deployments.  Consider
this story a sort of “executive summary” that will attempt
to at the very least introduce all the technology elements
that are part of the stunning new venue, which hosted its
first NFL games for both stadium tenants, the Los Angeles
Rams and the Los Angeles Chargers, in early September.

A FIELD-LEVEL VIEW OF THE VIDEOBOARD AND THE STADIUM.

Converged network a revolution for
stadiums

If the stunning architecture of SoFi Stadium and its
innovative elements like the oval, dual-sided videoboard
represent the realization of Rams owner and Hollywood
Park developer Stan Kroenke’s “art of the possible,” then
the converged network and its interlocking technologies
perhaps  represent  “the  art  of  the  practical,”  at  a  scale
somewhat unprecedented inside a large public venue.

If you poke your head inside older sports venues, you
are most likely to see separate networks and operation
centers  for  many  of  the  different  systems  –  wireless,
wired  networks,  broadcast,  and  building  operations.
Historically  the  case  has  been  made  that  those  who
know  those  systems  best  are  responsible  for  building
their  operations  –  but  the  silo  approach  often  brings
headaches  to  those  in  charge  of  overall  operations  for
the venue as a whole, as they deal with the proliferation
of different systems to operate and manage.

8      STADIUM TECH REPORT FALL 2020

AmpThink,  which  has  deployed  networks  in  more
than  70  venues  across  the  country,  pioneered  the  idea
of  a  single,  converged  stadium  network  when  it  built
the prototype at the 14,000-seat Dickies Arena last year.
But the size and scope of the converged network project
at  SoFi  Stadium  –  which  will  hold  70,000  fans  for  NFL
games and up to 100,000 for special events like the Super
Bowl – was much larger. Still, according to AmpThink’s
Anderson, the planned outcome was the same: to deliver
the best outcome for the customer.

“It all works together, because it’s designed to work
together,”  said  Anderson.  “Instead  of  fighting  to  see  if
one  switch  works  with  another,  you  can  focus  on  the
business.”

  With 120 separate remote telecommunications rooms
– including some hardened for hot weather conditions in
the outside areas of Hollywood Park – the SoFi Stadium
converged network is designed to present a “single pane

of  glass”  management  structure,  where  there  are  no
“islands” requiring special attention. Even the live video
production system, usually a completely separate entity, is
run on a connected Cisco Nexus switched environment.
Every  telecommunications  closet  or  cabinet  is  directly
connected  via  fiber  to  the  campus  core.  According  to
AmpThink, all the telecom rooms have edge switches that
use 25 Gbps optics and a minimum of two connections
per closet/cabinet to provide an aggregate of 50 Gbps of
campus interconnectivity.

The blanket of Wi-Fi and cellular
coverage
  On  the  Wi-Fi  side,  the  SoFi  Stadium  network  is
the  biggest  AmpThink  has  built  in  a  stadium,  with
approximately 2,400 APs inside the venue and another
300 in the surrounding Hollywood Park area. For the full
Wi-Fi  6  Cisco  deployment,  AmpThink  used  an  under-
seat deployment in the main bowl. Before expanding to
include  full  stadium  technology  integration,  AmpThink

made  its  name  in  successful  big-venue  Wi-Fi  network
design  and  deployment,  with  networks  built  most
recently  at  Mercedes-Benz  Stadium  in  Atlanta,  and  last
year at Ohio State and Oklahoma University, the first two
large-stadium networks to move exclusively to the new
Wi-Fi 6 standard.

In  a  commitment  to  offering  the  best  possible

connectivity  to  consumer  devices  no  matter
which  network  they  use,  the  Wi-Fi  and  cellular
distributed antenna system (DAS) at SoFi Stadium
were both designed to each provide 100 percent
venue coverage. The DAS, designed and deployed
by  DAS  Group  Professionals  using  gear  from
JMA Wireless, is the largest ever deployed. According to
Hedinsson,  the  network  has  2,400  antennas  and  3,200
remotes, and is capable of covering all licensed spectrum
bands between 600 MHz to 6 GHz.

As cellular carriers move toward the 5G future, the

DAS  is  capable  of  supporting  all  the  low-  and  mid-
band  spectrum  currently  planned  for  use.  According
to  Hedinsson,  there  will  also  be  millimeter-wave  5G
services  in  the  stadium,  from  a  carrier  to  be  named
later. The stadium networks are supported by 50 Gbps
backbone links.

Bringing data center strategies to
the stadium
  While hyper-convergence of server use is common in
the data center space, that has traditionally not been the
case in sports and entertainment venue operations. But
the  eventual  compute  network  built  for  SoFi  Stadium’s
operations even surprised AmpThink’s Anderson, whose
company  originally  estimated  a  compute  environment
with perhaps 20 to 30 virtual machines.

A s  it  stands  now,  Anderson  said  the

compute  environment  has  almost
100  VMs,  which  host  applications
for  all  the  network  operations  as
well as varied building management
light,  HVAC,
needs
security, and even specialized systems like irrigation and
seismic monitoring. Instead of a mix of servers running
siloed  applications  on  separate  physical  machines  with
different  operating  systems,  the  SoFi  Stadium  compute

like  power,

environment  is  a  unified  platform  and  includes  a
seamless integration into Google Cloud, allowing it to be
easily scaled to meet current and future needs.

A digital stadium with displays big
and small

Any  discussion  of  digital  displays  at  SoFi  Stadium
has to start with the main videoboard, a one-of-a-kind
design  of  a  120-foot  long  oval  that  circles  the  playing
field, with dual-sided 4K screens, some 40 feet in height.
(Please see our detailed profile of the main videoboard
in our recent Venue Display Report.)

The digital display footprint goes far beyond the main
screen, with some 2,600 other smaller boards deployed
throughout the venue and in Hollywood Park. According
to  Hedinsson,  the  ability  of  the  Cisco  Vision  display
management system is a key part of the “digital stadium”
design, especially when you consider that the venue has
two  main  tenants,  each  with  their  own  branding  and
look and feel.

“Being digital means we can switch over the brand-
ing [by changing displays] instead of physically having to
move signs,” said Hedinsson. “That’s why we have Cisco
Vision. We have digital ‘playbooks’ for the different sce-
narios, and we can just push them out as needed.” –STR–

victory over the New Orleans Saints, a decision made by
the team earlier in the year meant that no fans were on

to enter the building, they will be treated to what should
be  among  the  best  game-day  technical  experiences
anywhere, as a combination of innovation and expertise
has permeated the venue’s deployments of wireless and
video technologies.

copper and cable infrastructure from CommScope, back-
bone  services  from  Cox  Business/Hospitality  Network,
digital displays from Samsung, and design and converged
network  planning  directed  by  AmpThink,  the  Raiders
have used an all-star team of partners to reach the orga-
nization’s desire to provide what Raiders’ vice president
of IT Matt Pasco calls “a top-notch fan experience.”

14      STADIUM TECH REPORT FALL 2020

Finally getting to build a stadium network
For Pasco, who is in his 19th year with the Silver and
Black, the entity that became Allegiant Stadium was the
realization of something he’d never had: A stadium net-
work to call his own.

From  1995  until  the  end  of  last  season,  the  then-
Oakland  Raiders  played  home  games  in  the  Oakland
Alameda  County  Coliseum,  where  they  were  tenants
and shared the building with MLB’s Oakland Athletics.

      According  to  Pasco ,  since  the  Raiders  didn’t
have  the  ability  to  direct  capital  improvements,  “we
never got to buil d a sufficient DAS, and we never
got  to have sufficient Wi-Fi for all our fans.”

Fast-forward  to  the  plans  that  eventually  took
shape with the move of the team to Las Vegas, and for a
change  Pasco  was  able  to  start  thinking  about  what
that  meant  from  a  technology  perspective.  With  his
long tenure and relationships around the league, Pasco
said  he  embarked  on  a  several  years-long  “stadiums
tour”  of  accompanying  the  team  for  road  games,
looking  at  what  other  teams  had done at their venues.

“I  kept  a  big  notebook  on  what  I  liked,  and  what
didn’t seem to work,” Pasco said. “I sat down with a lot
of my counterparts and talked about what worked well,
and what they had to spend time with. So I got a really
good sense of what was possible.”

“We did look at Extreme [for the new build] but Cisco
just has so many pieces of the stack,” Pasco said. “Things
like inconsistencies between switch maker A and IPTV
vendor B are a little less likely to happen. And they’ve
done good things in so many buildings.”

Wi-Fi 6 arrives just in time
  One fortunate event for Allegiant Stadium’s wireless
deployment  was  the  2019  arrival  of  equipment  that
supported  the  new  Wi-Fi  6  standard,  also  known  as
802.11ax.  With  its  ability  to  support  more  connections,
higher  bandwidth  and  better  power  consumption  for
devices, Wi-Fi 6 is a great technology to start off with,
Pasco said.

“We  were  very  fortunate  that  Wi-Fi  6  was  released
just in time [to be deployed at Allegiant Stadium],” Pasco
said. “The strength of 802.11ax will pay off in a highly
dense stadium with big crowds.”

The  Raiders’  choice  of  Cisco  as  a  Wi-Fi  provider
wasn’t a complete given, even though Pasco said that the
team has long been “a Cisco shop” for not just Wi-Fi but
for core networking, IPTV and phones.

Pasco  also  praised  the  Wi-Fi  network  design  and
deployment  skills  of  technology  integrator  AmpThink,
which used an under-seat deployment design for Wi-Fi
APs in the main seating bowl. Overall, there are approx-
imately 1,700 APs total throughout the venue.

“I am thrilled with the work AmpThink has done,”
said Pasco, who admitted that as a network engineer, he
had “never done” a full stadium design before.

“They [AmpThink] have built networks at more than
70  venues,  so  they  came  highly  recommended,”  Pasco
said.  “And  meeting  their  leadership  early  on  sold  me
pretty quickly.”

Part of what AmpThink brought to the stadium was
a converged network design, where every connected de-
vice is part of the same network.

Innovation abounds in the DAS

If  the  Wi-Fi  world  is  already  moving  forward  with
general  availability  of  Wi-Fi  6  gear,  the  cellular  side  of
the equation is in a much different place as carriers con-

template how to best move forward with their latest stan-
dard, 5G.

F or venues currently adding or upgrading

a DAS, the 5G question looms large. One
of the hardest things about planning for
5G is that the main U.S. cellular carriers
will all have different spectrum bands in
use,  making  it  hard  to  deploy  a  single
“neutral host” DAS to support all the providers. Currently,
all previous 5G deployments in stadiums have been sin-
gle-carrier builds – but that won’t be the case in Allegiant
Stadium, thanks to some new gear from JMA.

Steve Dutto, president of DGP – which used JMA gear
at many of its other stadium DAS installations, including
the San Francisco 49ers’ Levi’s Stadium and most recently
at the Texas Rangers’ new home, Globe Life Field – said
the DAS deployed at Allegiant Stadium “is like no other”
NFL-venue cellular network.

“By selecting JMA DAS equipment we were able to
deploy  a  [5G  standard]  NR  radio  capable  system  from
day  one,”  Dutto  said.  “This  means  that  all  carriers  can
deploy  5G  low-  and  mid-band  technology  without  any
additional cost or changes to the DAS system.”

According  to  Dutto  and  JMA,  the  JMA  TEKO  DAS

16      STADIUM TECH REPORT FALL 2020

antennas cover all major licensed spectrum used, from
600MHz to 2500 MHz. and will provide ubiquitous cov-
erage over the entire stadium.

“Carriers  will  be  able  to  deploy  their  4G  technolo-
gies along with their low- and mid-band 5G technology
over all of the stadium coverage area,” Dutto said. “No
upgrades will be required. All carriers will need to do is
provide their base radios in the headend.”

According to Todd Landry, corporate vice president,
product and market strategy at JMA, the TEKO gear used
at Allegiant Stadium “employs an industry unique nine-
band  split  architecture,  placing  lower  frequency  bands
in  different  radios  than  higher  frequency  bands.”  This
approach,  Landry  said,  lets  the  stadium  “optimize  the
density of higher band cells versus lower bands” while
also reducing the total  number of radios needed for low
bands by half.

Landry said the JMA gear also has integrated support
for the public safety FirstNet spectrum band, and is soft-
ware programmable, allowing venue staff to “turn on” ca-
pabilities per carrier as needed, eliminating on-site visits
to install additional radios or radio modules. According to
DGP the DAS has 75 high-band zones and 44 low-band
zones in the main seating bowl, with a total of 117 high-
band and 86 low-band zones throughout the venue.

Adding in the MatSing antennas from
above
  One twist in the DAS buildout was the addition of 30
MatSing lens antennas to the cellular mix, a technology
solution  to  potential  coverage  issues  in  some  hard-to-
reach areas of the seating bowl. According to Pasco the
Raiders  were  trying  to  solve  for  a  typical  DAS  issue  –
namely, how to best cover the premium seats closest to
the field, which are the hardest to reach with a traditional
top-down DAS antenna deployment.

“We looked at a hybrid approach, to use under-seat
[DAS] antennas for the first 15 or 20 rows, but the cost
was astronomical,” Pasco said. “We also heard that [an
underseat deployment] may not have performed as well
as we wanted.”

The  MatSing  antennas,  which  are  ball-shaped  and
support greater distance between antenna and end-de-
vice, were already designed for use in the Allegiant Sta-
dium  “Peristyle”  gathering  area,  where  there  is  a  large
open space where fans are expected to gather – with a
large top-down distance between the area and the struc-
tures where antennas are mounted.

“I  had  heard  about  the  full  MatSing  deployment
at  Amalie  [Arena]  and  wondered  if  we  could  do  that,”
said Pasco. Fortunately for the Raiders, the architecture

18      STADIUM TECH REPORT FALL 2020

of  the  stadium,  with  a  high  ring  supporting  the  trans-
parent roof, turned out to be a perfect place to mount
MatSing  antennas,  which  use  line-of-sight  transmission
to  precisely  target  broadcast  areas.  For  Pasco,  a  move
toward more MatSings was a triple-play win, since it re-
moved the need for other antennas from walkways and
overhangs, was less costly than an under-seat network,
and should prove to have better performance, if network
models are correct.

“It  is  the  perfect  marriage  of  cost  reduction,  better
performance and aesthetics,” said Pasco of the MatSing
deployment.  “We  even  painted  them  black,  like  little
Black Holes,” Pasco said. “It’s one of the most innovative
decisions we made.”

“We are excited to be part of the Allegiant Stadium net-
work,” said MatSing CEO Bo Larsson. “It is a great venue
to show the capability of MatSing Lens antennas.”

Supporting wireless takes a lot of wires

Behind  all  the  wireless  antenna  technology  in  Al-
legiant  Stadium  –  as  well  as  behind  the  IPTV,  security
cameras  and  other  communications  needs  –  sits  some
227 miles of optical fiber and another 1.5 million feet of
copper cable, provided by CommScope.

A good balance of the 100 Gbps fiber connections

are used to support the stadium’s DAS network, with the
capacity built not just for current needs but for expect-
ed  future  demands  as  well.  According  to  CommScope
senior field applications engineer Greg Hinders the “spi-
der web of single-mode fiber” includes multiple runs of
864-strand  links,  which  break  out  in  all  directions  to
support all the networking needs.

For  the  cable  connections  to  the  Wi-Fi  gear,
CommScope’s design went with Cat 6A cable, which has
double the capabilities and a longer reach than standard
Cat 6.

“The new APs really require it [Cat 6A] so we went
standard with Cat 6A throughout the building,” Hinders
said.

the  stadium  required

And  if  the  job  wasn’t  tough  enough  –  limited
construction  space  at
that
CommScope and its distribution partner Anixter had to
stage its network in an offsite warehouse – CommScope
also had to make sure that exposed wiring was colored
silver  and  black  to  match  the  stadium  design  and  the
team’s colors.

  While  single-mode  fiber  is  usually  colored  yellow,
Hinders is enough of a football fan to know that Pittsburgh
Steelers colors wouldn’t fly in the Raiders’ home.

“It all had to be black and grey,” said Hinders. “Black

and yellow isn’t good for the Raiders.”

The  MatSing  antennas  also  posed  a  challenge  for
CommScope,  since  each  MatSing  antenna  requires  48
individual connections for all the radios in each device.

“It  was  [another]  logistical  challenge,”  said  Hinders.
“But it was great to see [the entire network] all come to
fruition. It’s nice to know we had a part in putting it all
together.”

Providing enough backbone bandwidth

To ensure that Allegiant Stadium had enough back-
bone  bandwidth  to  support  all  its  communications
needs,  the  Raiders  turned  to  Cox  Business/Hospitality
Network, a partner with considerable telecom assets in
the Las Vegas area.

Jady West, vice president of hospitality for Cox, noted
that not only does Cox have experience in providing data
services  to  high-demand  venues  (including  State  Farm
Stadium  in  Glendale,  Ariz.,  which  routinely  hosts  big
college games and the Super Bowl), it also has a wealth

to  the  big  casino  hotels  and  the  Las  Vegas  Convention
Center.

  With  a  100  Gbps  regional  network,  West  said  Cox
is able to bring “quite a bit of power and flexibility” to
the equation. Having supplied services to big events like
CES at the LVCC, West said, “takes a specialized skill, and
that’s what my team does. This is what we do.”

Specifically  for  the  Raiders,  Cox  built  two  40-Gbps
redundant  pipes  just  to  serve  the  needs  of  Allegiant
Stadium. Additionally, Cox built a 10 Gbps metro Ethernet
link between the stadium and the team’s headquarters and
practice facility in nearby Henderson, Nev., a connection
that Pasco said would be essential for stadium operations
as well as the on-field football business.

“Both  the  video  production  staff  and  the  football
staff  can  now  push  information  back  and  forth  like
we’re in the same building,” said Pasco, who gave high
praise to Cox’s work. From a production side, crews at
headquarters  can  create  content  for  videoboards  and
displays,  and  have  it  at  the  stadium  instantaneously;
similarly, video from the stadium’s field of play or from
practices can be shared back and forth as needed, in a
private and real-time fashion.

  West  said  Cox,  which  also  provides  game-day
network  support  and  a  “NOC  as  a  service”  solution,

20      STADIUM TECH REPORT FALL 2020

knows that the data demands of the big-time events that
will  likely  be  held  at  Allegiant  Stadium  will  only  keep
increasing, and it built its systems to support that growth.

“The  most  demanding  events  are  things  like  CES,
and NFL games,” West said. “This network is built for the
future, to hold up for all those events.”

Videoboards to fit the design

Last  but  certainly  not  least  in  the  technology  arse-
nal at Allegiant Stadium are the Samsung videoboards.
Above the south end zone, the largest board measures
approximately 250 feet long by 49 feet high, according to
Pasco. Two identical sized boards of 49 feet by 122 feet
are in the corners of the north end zone. Including rib-
bon boards, Pasco said there is a total of 40,000 square
feet of LED lights inside the seating bowl.

  On  the  stadium’s  exterior  there  is  another  large
videoboard,  a  275-foot  mesh  LED  screen  that  fits  in
perfectly with the bright lights of the city’s famed Strip.
Inside,  the  venue  will  also  have  approximately  2,400
TV  screens  for  information  and  concessions,  with
all  the  systems  controlled  by  the  Cisco  Vision  display
management system. –STR–

SPECIAL COMMENTARY

OPPORTUNITIES TO
TRANSFORM VENUES
UNDER THE
‘COVER OF COVID’

BY BILL ANDERSON
President, AmpThink

T he  Covid-19

pandemic,
which  has  ground  many
venue  operations  to  a  halt,
provides  the  opportunity...
“under the cover of the new
normal”  ...  to  think  about
how we can transform a system that has op-
erated  with  evolutionary  change  since  the
time that Romans staged gladiator fights.

  While  the  venues  of  today  are  bigger,
more comfortable, and have more amenities,
the flow of people and method of service remains un-
changed.  Fans  enter  the  building  perpendicular  to  the
playing surface, they circulate on a concourse that is par-
allel  to  the  playing  surface,  and  they  reach  their  seats
arranged parallel to the playing surface by walking down
an inclined aisle that is perpendicular to the playing sur-
face. Once seated, fans are separated by inches in seats
that haven’t grown much in spite of the generally larger
humans that occupy them.

Efforts  to  provide  an  orderly  experience  are  com-
plicated  by  the  fans  that  the  venues  serve.  During  an
engaging event, fans remain seated in the bowl clinging
to the excitement of the developing play. Concourse traf-
fic dwindles; concessionaires sit idle; and bathrooms are
empty. Breaks in the action send fans scrambling to the
concourse,  over-running  the  venue  amenities.  But  that
was then. Now, venue operations must change, at least
in the near term.

22      STADIUM TECH REPORT FALL 2020

To  open  venues  to  fans  while  the  pan-
demic  is  still  active,  keeping  venue  attend-
ees, workers and performers safe will require
using  technology  and  procedures  to  effect
social distancing, reducing the risk of trans-
mitting an infection. For many reasons, “the
way we always did things” will not work any-
more. Only live events will tell us how many
fans  will  attend  live  events  encumbered  by
hurdles imposed by some of the existing ven-
ue-opening  plans.  Examples  include  timed
entry and exit and seating “pods” to enforce

fan separation.

But what if some of the ideas that have

surfaced  for  Covid-19  compliance  are
simply  a  better  way  of  doing  things?
What if, in addition to providing social
distancing and less human interaction,
Covid-induced changes produce a bet-
ter  fan  experience,  generate  more  revenue,  and/or  im-
prove operational data for venue owners and operators?
If technologies and practices that have been resisted in
the past are a better fit, even in the absence of the pan-
demic,  why  not  make  those  changes  now  when  fans,
owners, and operators are more receptive, or forced to
trying something new?

In  our  research  conversations  this  year  with  Stadi-
um Tech Report we heard from several venue-business
insiders who all agreed that many facets of venue opera-

“NEVER LET A GOOD CRISIS GO TO WASTE”

WINSTON CHURCHILL

tions – especially activities like ticketing and concessions
– have long been governed by the sentiment of “if it ain’t
broke,  don’t  fix  it.”  As  long  as  concessions  were  still  a
profitable business – even with the inevitable losses and
lack of customer data that come with people paying for
things with cash – many stadiums and teams were loath
to  even  think  about  jeopardizing  the  income  from  the
ever-dwindling percentages of fans who didn’t want to
use credit cards or other digital payment methods.

  Here’s a quick list of things we envision many venues
deploying “under the cover of Covid” that could become
part of “the new normal.”

Digital ticketing or ticketless entry

As detailed in the profile of new venue entry methods
found in this issue, some teams and venues have already
implemented technology that lets fans enter the stadium
without showing any ticket at all, using near-field com-
munications or other digital technologies to confirm (via
mobile  device)  that  the  entering  fan  has  a  valid  ticket.
For Covid-19 compliance, the ability to reduce the biggest
lines any venue has – for entry – makes this idea almost
a necessary one if you want to eliminate long queues of
people who are all trying to get inside before the game
starts.

If this idea sounds futuristic to you, remember that
in  just  a  few  years  airlines  migrated  plane  tickets  from
paper to digital with great success. That change has im-
proved the air travel experience. While digital ticketing
has become the norm in many sports venues, it still faces
challenges  (like  sunlight  affecting  screen  readers)  that
make ticketless entry a logical improvement.

Better stadium apps or web apps for
in-stadium transactions

The evolution of the “stadium app” has shifted slowly
over  the  past  few  years  from  something  envisioned  as
mainly a content platform (watch replays from many dif-
ferent angles!) to more of a transaction platform (digital
ticketing,  experience  upgrades,  and  mobile  payments).
This evolution was primarily driven by fans’ reluctance
to  embrace  “official”  team  apps  because  there  was  not
enough value to convince fans to download the app and
interact  via  a  platform  that  was  different  for  each  ven-
ue. According to data we’ve seen from numerous events
where  wireless  networking  was  available,  most  fans  in
venues use their devices mainly to interact with popular
social-media platforms while official team or venue app
activity are lightly used.

  Under pandemic conditions digital ticketing is a ne-
cessity and contact-free concessions are a goal. We see

teams and venues doubling down on their stadium app
platforms  with  an  emphasis  on  transactions  over  con-
tent. In another profile in this issue, we also talk about
some of the leading venue-application providers offering
packages that include not just an app and app services,
but also an option for fans to simply scan a QR code that
produces  a  web  page  with  app-like  functionality  –  for
example  to  order  and  pay  for  a  beer  and  a  hot  dog  –
without forcing them to download and negotiate a tradi-
tional app.

More self-service and new retail options
  The pandemic will force teams to rethink their con-
cessions in a big way. Think fewer stands with counter
service and more grab-and-go or order-and-pick-up
options. Will these types of operations end up being
more popular than those of the past and become the
new normal? At the Denver Broncos’ Empower Field
at Mile High stadium last year, some self-serve bever-
age concession stands with checkout systems that used
cameras to automatically tally up whatever cans fans
had grabbed proved to be immensely popular, seem-
ingly both quicker and “more fun” to some of the fans
interviewed by Stadium Tech Report.

A recent trend in concessions has been

for  venues  to  offer  a  wide  range  of
food  and  beverage  options  such  as
special  sandwiches  or  craft  beer
stands. Perhaps the current need for
simplicity  will  diminish  this  interest
in special foods or drinks. It will also be interesting to
see  the  statistics  from  a  wider  implementation  of  ideas
like kiosk-ordering or mobile ordering and payment with
express  (or  timed)  order  pickup,  ideas  that  had  limit-
ed trials in the past. Could the speeding up concessions
make the old walkup windows a thing of the past?

The same thoughts can be applied to team merchan-
dise  stores,  which  typically  consume  valuable  in-venue
real  estate.  Covid-19  has  forced  huge  changes  to  shop-
ping outside of venues; more online ordering and less in-
store browsing. Will the team-store experience change in
venues? Instead of a big area with T-shirts on racks and
hats on shelves, venues are experimenting with “virtual
shopping” kiosks or displays, where fans can see what a
T-shirt or hat might look like and then order it on their
phone for delivery to their home, a suite, or even to a
code-secured nearby locker.

As  the  great  Winston  Churchill  said  during  World
War II, “Never let a good crisis go to waste.” Now might
be the time to overhaul venue operations for greater effi-
ciency and a better fan experience. –STR–

 PANDEMIC
PLANNING
PUTS FOCUS ON
VENUE ENTRY,
CONCESSIONS

BY PAUL KAPUSTKA

COVID 19: RETURN
TO VENUES

  As some venues take baby steps forward in allowing limited
fan attendance at events, for most venues the ongoing effects
of the Covid-19 pandemic are forcing owners and operators
to take a longer look at the technologies and procedures that
can help provide safer situations for large crowds inside public
spaces for the foreseeable future.

  And if keeping fans farther apart from each other is one of
the simplest and best methods of enabling safer gatherings,
it makes sense that many venues and technology and service
providers are currently concentrating on venue entry and
concession operations, with an eye toward using technology
and procedures to cut down or eliminate the long lines that
have long been a part of a game-day experience.

B efore  the  pandemic  changed  events

forever,  many  venues  and  fans  were
stuck in the systems and practices that
had been the same for decades. While
some  forward-looking  venues  were
experimenting with innovative digital
technologies for entry and concessions operations, most
were still caught somewhere in between the past and the
future, with a mix of digital ticketing, paper tickets, cash
transactions for parking and concessions, and bottleneck
walkway  traffic  situations  often  caused  by  the  random
geography of stadiums, some built as long as 100 years
ago. Fan behavior often contributed to these crowded sit-
uations, with the last-minute crush of entries from people
who stayed at tailgate gatherings until just before kickoff
a somewhat unwanted tradition at many stadiums across
the country. But now, all that has changed.

The forced changes of Covid

In  a  wide  series  of  interviews  with  venue  owners
and  operators,  team  representatives,  and  technology
manufacturers and service providers, we’ve seen general
agreement with the idea that many of the “old ways of
doing things” at events will no longer be possible as the
pandemic  continues,  and  most  likely  even  after  it  sub-
sides from its current critical state. Going forward, events
in  large  public  venues  will  need  to  adopt  technologies
and procedures aimed at not just keeping fans safe, but
also to make them feel safe, and confident that the stadi-
um operation is doing all it can in those regards.

The two areas of operations we are focusing on with
this  story  are  the  two  that  easily  account  for  the  high-
est  potential  of  long  lines:  Stadium  entry,  and  conces-
sions. While historically these two operations have been

26      STADIUM TECH REPORT FALL 2020

fan-experience  pain  points  in  almost  every  venue,  the
good news is that mature technologies already exist to
help solve for problems in both areas – and some best
practices  have  already  emerged  from  forward-looking
venues and providers who embraced these ideas prior to
the pandemic. What follows is a look at some of the tech-
nologies and services available for entry and concessions
operations,  with  insights  from  early  adopters  and  from
the companies involved in the deployments.

Digital tickets and faster scanning

Just  like  when  airline  ticketing  went  from  print-
ed  paper  to  mostly  mobile-device  systems,  so  has  the
stadium and event entry business been changing. Prior
to  the  pandemic,  most  venues  of  any  size  had  at  least
some kind of digital ticketing system in place, with many
moving to digital-only processes over the past few years.
While there were still some holdouts, most of the people
we interviewed agreed that the desire to make activities
like parking lot and stadium entry faster and contact-free
is now driving venues to adopt digital ticketing at a rapid
pace.

“The  tone  has  completely  changed,”  said  Karri  Za-
remba, who until recently was chief operating officer at
stadium app developer Venuetize (Zaremba is now a se-
nior vice president with Major League Baseball, for ball-
park  experience  and  ticketing).  According  to  Zaremba,
this  past  summer  teams  and  venues  were  showing  “an
eagerness and hunger” for digital ticketing systems that
Venuetize hadn’t seen before.

“Everyone  is  scrambling  to  figure  out  a  plan  to  re-
form venues and remove humans from the [interaction]
equation,” Zaremba said.

  George Baker, founder and CEO of parking technol-
ogy  provider  ParkHub,  agreed  that  the  need  to  reduce
hand-to-hand or face-to-face transactions is driving more
technology in venue entry, beginning at the gate to the
parking lot. ParkHub, which recently signed a deal with
venue  management  firm  Spectra  to  provide  parking-lot
technology  to  Spectra-managed  properties,  also  raised
an additional $15 million in venture funding this spring
to help accelerate its business.

According  to  Baker,  while  fans  may  have  long  re-
sisted any changes to the way things have always been
done,  he  is  confident  that  the  safety  of  digital  transac-
tions,  plus  the  expanding  features  available  via  digital
platforms – such as premium lot differentiation and the
ability  to  reserve  spots  ahead  of  time  –  will  accelerate
the  use  of  technology  in  parking  lot  entry  as  well  as
many other game-day transactions. And as more fans use
digital payment methods for parking, teams and venues
can  also  better  manage  their  inventory,  with  real-time
updates.

“For venues, it’s no longer a nicety, it’s a necessity,”

said Baker of digital transactions.

One venue that has made a name for

itself by its use of innovative fan-fac-
ing  technology  is  the  Los  Angeles
Football  Club’s  Banc  of  California
Stadium,  which  opened  in  2018.
Christian  Lau,  chief  technology  of-
ficer  for  Major  League  Soccer’s  LAFC,  said  contact-free
entry  and  transactions  have  always  been  a  part  of  the
venue’s plan.

In  fact,  before  the  pandemic  started  the  club  was
working  with  security  technology  provider  Patriot  One
to help develop a new entry-gate system that would in-
clude innovations including eliminating the need for the
single-person  metal  detectors  as  well  as  future  support

for entry via facial recognition technology. LAFC is using
entry  gate  technology  from  Axess,  a  Salzburg,  Austria-
based provider.

“It is all part of redefining our great fan experience,
and redefining the security stack,” said Lau. “We want to
let you walk into the stadium like you’re walking into a
Target store.”

“Everyone is scrambling to
figure out a plan to reform
venues and remove humans
from the interaction equation.”

  Other venues, including the University of Oklahoma,
are already borrowing from the airline playbook, by put-
ting in more self-scanning ticket kiosks. The NFL’s Jack-
sonville Jaguars, one of a small number of pro football
teams who are allowing fans to attend in limited num-
bers,  said  they  have  installed  new  metal  detectors  that
allow  fans  to  keep  things  like  keys  and  cell  phones  in
their pockets when entering. Kim Rometo, vice president
and CIO for the Miami Dolphins, said that Miami’s Hard
Rock Stadium now has “walk-through, multi-zone metal
detectors”  that  let  fans  keep  items  in  their  pockets  to
speed up entry.

Temperature scans are a costly addition
  One technology that got a lot of attention this sum-
mer was thermal detection devices, usually cameras that
could  scan  people  to  detect  a  high  body  temperature,
one of the signs of a possible Covid-19 infection. While
such cameras are already in use in some places like air-
ports, we have yet to find a major U.S. sports venue that
has committed to installing thermal cameras for fan en-
try. The reason why? A combination of high costs (each
scanner  device  can  cost  $10,000  or  more)  and  unclear
results,  especially  when  used  in  large-scale  operations
like fans coming in to an event.

  While  many  sports  teams  are  using  thermal  detec-
tion devices to help keep staff and players safe as they
enter team buildings and the stadiums, the prospect of
trying  to  extend  those  operations  to  thousands  of  fans
is a problem that requires an extra level of operational
procedures. Chip Swisher, director in the smart solutions
practice  at  CenturyLink,  said  venues  looking  to  install
thermal  detection  systems  need  to  consider  placement
(since  the  cameras  do  not  work  as  well  in  bright  sun-
light)  and  other  mitigating  factors,  like  fans  just  getting
hot from being in the sun at a tailgate party. Teams will
also need to develop procedures on how to handle fans
who  do  show  a  high  temperature,  either  with  cooling
tents (where they can be re-tested after a short time pe-
riod) or with further testing or ways to refuse entry.

At  some  venues  temperature  checks  are  being  per-
formed, by staff members with handheld devices, a pro-
cess that may possibly introduce more safety issues than
it solves by forcing the person-to-person proximity. For
most venues, the temperature-check process is currently
a “wait and see” item, as they monitor what other venues
are doing and what, if any, requirements for temperature
checks are made by local governent or health officials.

Spacing and timed entry and departure

If televison views of some of the first games with fans
allowed in the stands are any proof, the idea of keeping
fans spaced far apart in the stands seems to be working,

28      STADIUM TECH REPORT FALL 2020

except at some college games where students apparently
violated safety precautions by massing together once in-
side the venue, often without masks.

For  most  teams  that  are  starting  to  allow  fans  into
stadiums, the digital ticket and the team or stadium ap-
plication is the primary vehicle for keeping fans at safe
distances when they enter and stay at the venue.

“We stretched existing solutions to meeting the need
[for distancing],” said the Dolphins’ Rometo. “Ticketmas-
ter introduced the ability to define seating pods for social
distance and space them six feet from one another. We
[also] program the digital tickets to display the preferred
gate for social distancing along with a specific entry time.
All  social  distancing  signage  will  be  displayed  on  Cis-
co Vision throughout the concourses and we augmented
eight LED boards at entrances to communicate entrance
times.”

  While some venues have floated the idea of having
set departure times, Rometo said that at Hard Rock Sta-
dium fans can leave at any time they choose. If they stay
until  the  end,  she  said,  ushers  will  try  to  dismiss  rows
in  an  order  to  keep  social  distancing  –  but  added  that
the space available inside the venue should keep crowds
from forming.

“Hard Rock Stadium can hold more than 65,000 so

LEFT: FANS ORDER AND PAY VIA KIOSKS IN DENVER LAST SEASON; RIGHT: CHASE CENTER IN SAN FRANCISCO HAD
STANDS WITH KIOSKS AND CARD-ONLY PAYMENT DURING LAST FALL’S SEASON. CREDIT: PAUL KAPUSTKA, STR

we  fully  expect  dismissing  13,000  will  still  occur  in  a
timely fashion,” said Rometo of the team’s expected early
attendance allowance.

And  while  some  teams  are  eliminating  tailgating
completely, others like the Kansas City Chiefs are imple-
menting spacing protocols in the parking lots, with every
other space blocked off so that fans can’t park side by
side.

Concessions: Lessons learned from
retail, fast food

If there was one place in many stadiums that needed
an  overhaul  even  before  the  pandemic,  it  was  conces-
sions.  According  to  Moon  Javaid,  chief  strategy  officer
for  the  San  Francisco  49ers,  customer  experience  sur-
veys have consistently shown concessions to be “the low-
est-rated aspect” across all sports.

Anothy Perez, CEO of stadium app developer Venu-
eNext, explained why that experience has been poor at
so many venues for so long.

“Deviating from the normal is a risk,” Perez said. “If
you stick to the old wisdom and something goes wrong,
it’s not your fault.”

Venues are realizing that if
they didn’t have contact-free
concessions systems in place,
they need to rapidly do so,
“because it’s the future.”

But the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic, Perez said,
“gives you cover to try something new. It’s a paradigm
shift.”

30      STADIUM TECH REPORT FALL 2020

  With her Venuetize hat on, Zaremba said that many
venues might not have moved forward faster with inno-
vative  concessions  strategies  in  part  to  avoid  alienating
older customers.

“All that is now out the window,” Zaremba said. New
methods  of  contact-free  or  lower-contact  transactions,
she said, are “going to be demanded” by fans who have
gotten used to such interactions in the daily life of the
pandemic, where most restaurant meals are now primar-
ily consumed by to-go pickup or via delivery, with pay-
ments made electronically or via phone by credit card.

A ccording  to  our  interviews,  many

venues are quickly moving to change
as much of their concessions opera-
tions as they can to more contact-free
or  even  contactless
transactions,
where fans don’t have to talk face to
face with concessions staff. Last year, the Denver Broncos
had several new options along these lines at Empower
Field at Mile High, including grab-and-go beverage stores
that were basically rows of coolers where fans could take
whatever canned or bottled beverages they wanted, and
pay for them using an optical scanner (manufactured by
Mashgin). Other options in Denver included kiosk order-
ing for a chicken stand and several grab-and-go formats
where  prepackaged  food  was  available  to  fans  to  take
and pay for, again at a Mashgin scanner.

  Kevin  Anderson,  chief  strategy  officer  for  stadium
point-of-sale systems developer Appetize, said venues are
realizing that if they didn’t have contact-free concessions
systems in place, they need to rapidly do so, “because it’s
the future.” Appetize, which powered the systems at the
Broncos’ stadium, is currently in the process of bringing
more than 50 self-service kiosks to the Green Bay Pack-

ers’ Lambeau Field, which hopes to be able to host fans
sometime later this season.

Team and stadium apps get a new life
with concessions

Though kiosks do involve the process of touching a
screen, Anderson said most people have confidence that
a finger touch is a low-risk possibility of virus transmittal.

“The  highest  likelihood  of  transmittal  is  person  to
person,” Anderson said, voting for kiosks as  a  safer al-
ternative.  To  help  keep  the  process  even  safer,  Ander-
son said Appetize’s new screens have a “hospital grade”
screen protector that resists contamination. The kiosks,
he said, will also have hand sanitizer bottles attached for
fans to use.

The Niners’ Javaid said the team had already made a
decision to bring in more kiosk stations for some of its
regular  concessions  areas,  because  it  not  only  reduces
lines, but it also reduces the staffing requirements of a
regular concession stand.

“Staffing is expensive, and for us [in Silicon Valley] it’s
hard to get people,” said Javaid of the part-time work that
maybe involves 10 events a year. For regular concession
stands,  Javaid  said,  the  Niners  would  use  four  cashiers
and  four  food  expediters.  But  with  a  kiosk  system,  he
said, one person can handle the same number of orders,
allowing the team to repurpose the staff to other positions.

“And with kiosks, people can stand wherever [to wait
for their orders],” Javaid noted. “You don’t have to stand
in line.”

Appetize,  like  other  POS  developers,  also  supports
mobile ordering and payment for their concessions cus-
tomers,  another  area  where  many  venues  are  stepping
up  current  order-by-phone  operations  or  adding  them
if  they  didn’t  previously  support  them.  At  LAFC’s  Banc
of California Stadium fans have been able to use several
methods to order concessions digitally, including via the
team’s  Venuetize-built  app,  or  by  using  Apple  Business
Chat, or by simply scanning a QR code on a sign near a
stand, which brings up a web page with menus, order-
ing and payment instructions, making such transactions
available on the fly.

anywhere for their orders.
They don’t have to stand in line.

  When  VenueNext  was  born  as  the  provider  of  the
stadium app for the Niners’ Levi’s Stadium  in 2014, the
company was an all-or-nothing proposition for doing ev-
erything inside the app, including the venue’s since-dis-
continued feature of having in-seat delivery available to
every seat in the house. Perez, who took over the CEO
spot in 2018, has shifted the company’s strategy to em-
brace other mobile-ordering options like web-based QR-
code menus, and added a POS back-end system to sup-
port more mobile-ordering options. VenueNext debuted
its new mobile systems last season at the University of
Florida’s Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, aka “The Swamp.”

Venues going all-mobile or mostly mobile for conces-
sions may allow teams and venues to rethink their con-
course real estate and possibly innovate by adding space
for fan engagement or sponsor activation, Perez said.

“What  really  gets  interesting  is  how  you  can  open
up spaces” in the venue by streamlining concessions op-
erations,  Perez  said.  “The  beauty  of  mobile  is  that  you
can completely decouple shopping, ordering, paying and
fulfillment.”

LAFC’s  Lau  noted  that  there  is  still  an  operational
component  to  the  contact-free  experience,  namely  de-
signing systems that have necessary nuances, like sched-
uling pickup times so that fans aren’t all in the same area
at the same time.

“You  don’t  want  the  pickup  lines  to  back  up,”  Lau
said. “You need to eliminate lines, eliminate the friction
of lines.”

O ne  more  concessions  trend  that

some  stadiums  (like  Atlanta’s  Mer-
cedes-Benz  Stadium)  had  exper-
imented  with,  having  completely
cashless transactions, will now like-
ly be the norm going forward given
the  safety  concerns  associated  with  exchanging  paper
money.

“Venues were dipping their toes in the water before,
on  cashless,  but  now  they’re  leapfrogging  ahead,”  said
Zaremba, whose former company Venuetize is exploring

options that include biometrics that would allow fans to
“order with their face.” At Seattle’s CenturyLink Field, the
venue  has  partnered  with  security  provider  Clear  for  a
few concession stands that let fans pay for concessions
with a fingerprint reader, after first signing up to the Clear
system.

A mobile app that helps fans
locate where lines are the
shortest, is now using data
to improve Covid safety and
contact-free concessions.

If there is one other cutting-edge idea emerging, it’s
the Niners’ plan to make concessions all-inclusive for sea-
son ticket holders, a plan that was developed before the
pandemic  as  part  of  the  team’s  overall  overhaul  of  its
concessions operations.

  When the Niners have fans present to roll out their
all-inclusive  concessions  operations  –  where  all  sea-
son-ticket  holders  will  have  a  menu  of  the  most  pop-
ular  food  and  non-alcoholic  beverages  availble  as  part
of their ticket prices – they will use technology to assist
the deployment, including using the Cisco Vision display
management system to provide menu and directional in-
formation  via  TV  screens,  and  to  also  incorporate  the
camera-based  fan  movement  technology  system  devel-
oped  by  WaitTime  to  gather  information  on  how  fans
move  about  in  the  concourse  and  concession  areas.

As part of a plan developed before the pandemic, the Niners
will roll out an all-inclusive concessions operation – where
season-ticket holders will have a menu of the most popular
food and non-alcoholic beverages availble as part of their ticket
prices – they will use technology to assist the deployment,
providing menu and directional information via TV screens.

  WaitTime, which originally developed a mobile app
to help fans find out where concession and restroom lines
were  shortest  –  and  then  added  a  version  teams  could
broadcast  on  digital  displays  –  is  now  pivoting  to  add
more  granular  data  from  its  camera-based  systems  for
Covid safety and contact-free concession deployments.

Zachary  Klima,  WaitTime  CEO,  said  that  teams  are
going to need better information on where fans are mov-
ing  inside  venues  to  build  reliable,  safe  procedures  for
the new normal.

“Tape on the floor can only go so far,” Klima said.

“It’s  better  for  teams  to  know  where  people  are,  and
where they aren’t.”

The  Niners’  Javaid  agreed  with  the  data-driven  ap-

proach.

“How  are  people  queueing?  I  need  to  understand
that,”  Javaid  said.  “We’ve  never  done  this  before,  so  I
need data.” –STR–
