DO THE MATH
Wi-Fi 6 MAKES $ENSE

BY PAUL KAPUSTKA

E ven with the September introduction of

Apple’s iPhone 11 line, which all include
support for the new Wi-Fi 6 standard, it
is likely to be some time – maybe a year
or two – before the balance of devices
fans carry to stadiums will support Wi-
Fi 6. So if the question is, do you upgrade your network
now or keep milking Wi-Fi 5 until devices catch up – the
answer here is, move to Wi-Fi 6 as soon as you can. The
math on all fronts just makes too much sense to wait if
you don’t have to.

For new stadium installs, the move to Wi-Fi 6 seems
to be the educated choice. New networks at Oklahoma
and Ohio State (see profile in this issue) fully embraced
the new standard, even if the Wi-Fi 6 software in those

venues isn’t operational yet. Accord-
ing  to  AmpThink  president  Bill  An-
derson,  whose  firm  did  the  design
and  deployment  at  both  stadiums,
the math is simply a no-brainer, es-
pecially  given  the  long  capital  bud-
get  expenditure  schedules  at  most
public universities.

“The question to ask is when can you afford to re-
place your network?” said Anderson in a recent discus-
sion  during  an  MSR  visit  to  Fort  Worth,  Texas,  where
AmpThink is building out a converged fiber network at

“Wi-Fi 6 is making us rethink
how we can provide capacity...
now with what Wi-Fi 6 can
support, things are going to
get really interesting.”

the new Dickies Arena (see profile in this issue), which
will also have Wi-Fi 6 gear when it is finished. According
to Anderson, if you accept the premise that any technol-
ogy you install will “not be current” within 3 years after
its  deployment,  the  question  then  becomes,  when  will
you have the money for an upgrade?

W hile most big operations like uni-

versities  like  to  operate  on  10-
year  budget  cycles,  some  ven-
ues do have money set aside to
keep communications current on
a faster time frame. But even an
accelerated schedule might not be fast enough, Ander-
son argues.

“The  thing  about  Wi-Fi  6  is  that  it  is  NOT  a  minor
change,”  said  Anderson,  whose  firm  put  together  a  re-
port  on  Wi-Fi  6’s  new  capabilities  that  was  distributed
in the last issue of the Stadium Tech Report. Calling it a
“super significant” upgrade, especially for venues, means
that if you pass on moving to Wi-Fi 6 now, that means
with normal upgrade cycles it could be anywhere from 5
to 10 years before your venue catches up. By that time,
most of the devices fans bring to your venue will likely
support Wi-Fi 6, but they won’t be able to take advan-
tage of any of the new standard’s features if the stadium
network is stuck on Wi-Fi 5.

“If  you’re  sitting  on  the  fence,  it’s  time  to  get  off
the fence” and move forward with Wi-Fi 6, said Chuck
Lukaszewski,  Vice  President  of  Wireless  Strategy  &
Standards  at  Aruba,  a  Hewlett  Packard  Enterprise
company. “If you have the opportunity to deploy Wi-Fi
6, you should. It just makes a lot of sense.”

And while Wi-Fi 6 gear may be more expensive right
now, the things it will allow – such as greater capacity
and higher connection speeds, for starters – will provide
other  benefits  of  their  own  that  right  now  may  be  un-
seen, like the ability to reap more revenue from new ser-

vices supported by better networks. And with the biggest
network  usage  days  (like  at  Super  Bowls  or  other  big
events) pushing network spectrum use to near capacity,
can you afford to stick with the current Wi-Fi technology
as user wireless demands continue to grow rapidly with
no end in sight? How much will that bet cost if you are
incorrect?

“Wi-Fi 6 is making us rethink how we can provide
capacity,” Anderson said. “We used to joke about stadi-
ums having huge [backbone] pipes,” Anderson said, be-
cause it was thought that venues would never need the
capacity. “But now with what Wi-Fi 6 can support, things
are going to get really interesting.”

  Wi-Fi hardware vendors clearly believe in Wi-Fi 6 as
well, with Aruba supplying gear for both Ohio State and
Oklahoma, and Cisco following up with its own Wi-Fi 6
equipment  with  several  installs  already  underway.
Extreme Networks, which just announced a Wi-Fi 6 de-
ployment  at  Lucas  Oil  Arena  in  Indianapolis,  will  like-
ly have other NFL venue announcements coming soon.
Extreme also recently announced a deal to put a Wi-Fi
6 network into Houston’s BBVA Stadium, home of Ma-
jor League Soccer’s Houston Dynamo and the National
Women’s Soccer League’s Houston Dash.

R uckus, now a part of CommScope, also

has Wi-Fi 6 gear and the Wi-Fi Alliance
recently  announced  the  availability  of
Wi-Fi  6  certification,  so  venue  own-
ers and operators should have a wide
range of choices to help reduce poten-

tial prices through competition.

“We took a pretty hard look [at Wi-Fi 6], and the
timing  worked  out  pretty  well,”  said  Jim  Null,  Ohio
State’s CIO.  With huge Wi-Fi numbers in its first few
games, Ohio State’s network is only going to get better
when the Wi-Fi 6 features are enabled. “The risk was
worth the reward,” Null said. –MSR–

WI-FI ARRIVES AT
OHIO STADIUM

With its long tradition of excellence
in all things pertaining to college
football, is it any surprise that when
the Ohio State University finally got
Wi-Fi installed at Ohio Stadium the
network would instantly be one of
the best around?

O ver  this  past  offseason,  the  school

oversaw  the  first  comprehensive
installation  of  a  fan-facing  Wi-
Fi  network  inside  the  venerable
“Horseshoe,”  with  almost  2,000
access  points,  some  600  of  which
were  installed  in  handrail  enclosures  that  all  sport
the  Ohio  State  logo  engraved  on  each  side.  Live  and
operational for the Buckeyes’ home opener on Aug. 31,
the  network  saw  just  more  than  47,000  unique  users
its first day and carried more than 13 terabytes of data,
instantly  lifting  Ohio  State  to  the  front  of  the  class  in
single-day collegiate football Wi-Fi records.

Impressive as its first stats might be, the network will
only get significantly better in the near future as device
technology catches up with it. A decision to use the new
Wi-Fi 6 standard, also known as 802.11ax, in as many of
the APs as possible, will let Ohio State take advantage of
the technology’s promise of higher throughput and the
ability to handle more clients per AP when more fans get

their  hands  on  devices  that  support  Wi-Fi  6  and  bring
them to games.

During a visit by Mobile Sports Report for

the Aug. 31 game, close-up inspection
of  many  of  the  APs  in  a  pre-game
walkaround  saw  no  evidence  of  the
frenetic  summer  of  hard  work  getting
the  equipment  installed.  Using  Wi-Fi
gear from Aruba, a Hewlett Packard Enterprise company,
and  installed  with  with  a  design  by  AmpThink  (which
also  manufactured  the  AP  enclosures),  the  deployment
does an excellent job of looking like it’s been part of the
almost 100-year-old stadium for a long time, with discreet
wall and overhead antenna placements complementing
the standout handrail enclosures. And with connectivity
finally in their house, the Ohio State fans wasted no time
jumping  on  the  network,  with  many  fans  expressing
great  joy  at  being  able  to  use  their  wireless  devices  at
the game.

A bumpy road to Wi-Fi

Built  in  1922  as  one  of  the  then-largest  poured-
concrete structures, the building known officially as Ohio
STADIUM TECH REPORT    FALL 2019     9

Stadium (and also as “the Horseshoe,” or just “the Shoe”)
is among the biggest of the big, with capacity reaching
104,944 after renovations in 2014. That number actually
decreased a bit with a recent round of renovations that
removed  some  seats  in  favor  of  some  new  suite  areas,
but even with capacity of around 102,000, Ohio Stadium
is  still  among  the  top  echelon  of  Saturday  afternoon
shrines for its scarlet- and grey-clad followers.

  While the venue is long held in reverence by not just
Ohio State fans but by football fans in general, the things
that  make  it  a  great  place  to  watch  a  game  –  the  big,
open seating bowl and the historic concrete structure –
also make it a challenge to equip with modern wireless
technology. Back in 2012, it looked like the school had
solved  the  problem  by  signing  a  deal  with  Verizon  to
bring Wi-Fi to the football stadium and basketball arena.
But  according  to  several  reports,  the  installation  never
occurred  and  now  the  school  and  Verizon  are  still
involved in a lawsuit concerning the non-deployment.

Fast forward to 2018, and the school finally approved
a  measure  that  will  bring  connectivity  not  just  to  the
stadiums,  but  in  many  other  places  across  campus  as
well. Jim Null, senior associate athletic director and chief
information officer for Ohio State, noted that as a digital
program partner with Apple, the school gives all students
iPads as freshmen, leading to demands for coverage not
just in classrooms but anywhere students may wander.

“There  were  a  lot  of  coverage  gaps  on  campus,”
Null said. The new deal, reached in the spring of 2018,
approved $18.6 million in spending for wireless coverage

in the stadiums and across campus. According to Null, the
sports stadiums’ portion of that deal was approximately
$10  million.  Null  also  said  the  stadium  has  a  30  Gbps
backbone pipe, courtesy of the Ohio Academic Resources
Network (OARnet), the 100 Gbps network that connects
the state’s major cities and research institutions.

Handrails and Wi-Fi 6
  With a bill of material in hand for the deployment,
Null said that Aruba asked if the school wanted to use
Wi-Fi  6  gear,  which  was  available  this  spring  when
construction was to begin.

“It was good timing in a sense – Aruba came back
to us and said, why not go with Wi-Fi 6, and everyone
here  [at  the  school]  decided  that  was  a  good  idea,”
Null  said.  While  the  new  version  of  the  standard  will
improve  Wi-Fi  performance  in  any  kind  of  network,
at  large  sports  venues  the  improvements  will  likely  be
significant.  AmpThink  president  Bill  Anderson,  who  is
urging  most  new-construction  Wi-Fi  clients  to  install
Wi-Fi 6 if possible, calls the new standard “a significant
game-changer” for in-venue networks.

AmpThink’s Anderson, whose company has designed
and helps run networks in the biggest stadiums that see
the biggest events – including last year’s Super Bowl and
last year’s men’s NCAA Final Four – says that over the past
year or so, networks based on older Wi-Fi standards are
reaching  some  theoretical  limits,  mostly  with  spectrum

re-use. “We are getting to the cutting edge of what we
can  support,”  with  the  older  Wi-Fi  5  technology  (also
known as 802.11ac), Anderson said.

  Wi-Fi 6, however, promises to deliver more capacity
per  access  point,  along  with  better  techniques  for
communication  between  devices  and  access  points,
which  most  industry  followers  agree  should  produce
significant benefits, especially in venues where spectrum
re-use  is  necessary  given  the  large  numbers  of  APs
needed to provide coverage. While it’s true that it may
take some time before Wi-Fi 6 technology is on both the
access point and the balance of user devices in stadiums
(both sides of the equation need to support Wi-Fi 6 for
the  full  range  of  benefits  to  be  realized),  the  fact  that
many new devices – including the recently announced
Apple iPhone 11 line – contain support for Wi-Fi 6 means
that  the  full  improvements  will  likely  be  seen  sooner
rather than later.

“Ohio State made the right choice to go with Wi-Fi

6,” Anderson said.

P utting the APs into handrail enclosures

was  another  decision  point,  but  one
Null  said  the  school  was  unified
on.  Though  Aruba  has  traditionally
preferred  to  deploy  Wi-Fi  in  under-
seat placements, like in deployments at

“The combination of all three led us to the handrails,”
Null said, noting that with the ability to place two APs
into a single handrail enclosure, Ohio State was able to
approximately cut in half the number of holes it would
have  to  drill  into  the  concrete  to  string  cable  to  the
devices,  a  huge  savings  in  cost  and  construction  time.
With bleachers in most of its seating areas, Ohio Stadium
would have cut into under-seat spaces significantly with
under-seat APs, Null said.

Though  some  lower-bowl  areas  without  handrails
did  get  under-seat  AP  placements,  the  600  handrail
enclosures  –  all  manufactured  by  AmpThink  and
custom-stamped  with  an  Ohio  State  logo  –  now  wrap
around  the  entire  seating  bowl,  from  near  the  field  to
way  up  at  the  top  of  Deck  C.  Null  said  performance
from  some  other  recent  AmpThink  deployments  that
primarily  used  handrail  enclosures  –  including  Notre
Dame Stadium and U.S. Bank Stadium – led Ohio State
to believe that handrail installation techniques would be
“very comparable in performance” to under-seat.

And if the first two games with the network are any
indication,  the  Ohio  Stadium  handrail  enclosures  are
working just fine. According to the school the network
saw  47,137  unique  connections  out  of  103,228  in
attendance for the home opener against Florida Atlantic
on Aug. 31, with a peak concurrent connection number
of  28,900.  Total  bandwidth  tonnage  for  the  first  game

STADIUM TECH REPORT    FALL 2019     11

was 13.3 terabytes, a mark which already puts Ohio State
in  fifth  place  in  the  unofficial  all-time  Wi-Fi  single-day
record list kept by MSR.

  Ohio State’s second home game of the season, a week
later versus Cincinnati, was nearly equal in performance
statistics.  According  to  figures  provided  by  Ohio  State,
on Sept. 7 the network saw 47,579 unique connections
out  of  104,089  in  attendance,  with  a  peak  concurrent
connection mark of 28,900. Total tonnage for the second
game was 12.7 TB, good enough for sixth place on the
MSR list. Peak bandwidth rates were just over 10 Gbps
for the home opener, and just above 6 Gbps during the
second game.

Solid tests throughout the venue

An  unofficial  walk-around  testing  process  by  MSR
before  and  during  the  home  opener  showed  solid
performance in just about every part of the venue, from
outside the entry gates to all the seating areas low and
high, and on concourses and other busy walkways. Inside
of  Gate  14,  we  got  one  of  the  highest  Wi-Fi  speedtest
marks  in  the  stadium,  at  62.7  Mbps  on  the  download
side  and  72.1  Mbps  for  upload.  According  to  Null  the
entryways  are  well  covered,  with  four  access  points
hidden behind a directional sign that simply blends into
the structure.

Inside  the  stadium,  we  got  a  mark  of  49.2  Mbps  /
42.9  Mbps  in  the  seats  in  the  lower  bowl  around  the
45-yard  line,  an  area  covered  primarily  by  handrail
enclosures.  Closer  to  the  field  in  seats  along  the  goal

line on the press box side of the stadium we got a mark
of  51.2  Mbps  /  32.0  Mbps;  in  the  same  spot  we  tested
the DAS coverage for cellular and got a Verizon network
speedtest of 20.1 Mbps / 1.34 Mbps. According to Null
Verizon runs a neutral-host DAS inside the stadium, with
AT&T as a client.

B ack  on  Wi-Fi  with  the  stadium  still

closed  to  fans  we  went  up  into  the
metal  bleachers  in  the  non-curved
end zone and got a speed test of 38.6
Mbps  /  18.7  Mbps.  In  the  concourse
below these same stands we got a test

mark of 47.2 Mbps / 48.5 Mbps.

An elevator ride to Deck C and a hike up the steep
steps found us at the top row of the stadium, where the
Wi-Fi was still strong, with a mark of 42.0 Mbps / 35.6
Mbps in row 41. We then went down to Deck B on the
non-press box side of the stadium, where some concrete
overhangs  make  for  interesting  placements.  There,  we
saw Wi-Fi APs mounted above the seating areas pointing
down.  With  fans  starting  to  come  into  the  stadium  we
got a mark there of 24.3 Mbps / 45.2 Mbps; in the same
area the DAS provided a test of 21.8 Mbps / 12.6 Mbps,
again on the Verizon network.

The one place we found with poor Wi-Fi coverage
– down near the field in section 28AA – was one of the
few areas where Null said that the network deployment

was  not  yet  complete.  (The  Speedtest.net  app  we  use
for testing dropped during the test here; the same area
did have DAS coverage, with a mark of 16.9 Mbps / 4.66
Mbps on the Verizon network.)

That the network was near complete for the opening
game was a testament to extra work from all suppliers.
AmpThink,  which  outfitted  three  major  college  fields
this summer, had overtime shifts to manufacture enough
enclosures, while Aruba had to produce enough Wi-Fi 6
APs not just to fill Ohio State, but also Oklahoma, whose
stadium is of similar size.

“It  was  quite  a  ballet  dance  the  last  nine  months,”
said  Jeff  Weaver,  director  of  high  density  consulting  at
Aruba. “Hats off to the construction team.”

Perhaps the most impressive tests we got were taken
during  live  game  action,  one  just  after  an  Ohio  State
touchdown. In section 13 up on the C deck we wandered
out into the middle of celebrating fans and got a speedtest
of 59.9 Mbps / 57.9 Mbps. Walking down to section 27AA
on the press box side after yet another OSU touchdown
we sat in the aisle and got a speed test of 54.7 Mbps /
70.2 Mbps, from an area covered by handrail enclosures.

Fans happy now, likely to be even
happier in the future

If  Ohio  State  is  known  widely  for  its  football
excellence (Ohio State has eight national championship
titles to its name), its fans have known mostly wireless
frustration over the recent years, a situation that has now
changed 180 degrees. In several conversations with fans
MSR heard how happy OSU fans were now “that we can
actually use our phones!” And as good as the network
speed  tests  and  overall  performance  is  now,  it’s  worth
noting that the Wi-Fi 6 advancements are not yet even
being used – meaning that when more fans have Wi-Fi 6
enabled devices the network should perform even better,
leading to faster connections and more capacity for all.

  Null said that Ohio State will also be deploying the
Passpoint software in the future, which allows for automatic
sign-on to the Wi-Fi network and better support for device
roaming. Ohio State does not ask fans to log in with any
sort  of  email  information  or  personal  identification  –
all they need to do is select the OSUfanWiFi SSID and
connect. And if the first two games are any indication,
many Ohio State fans will continue to do so with great
appreciation for the foreseeable future.  –MSR–

CONVERGED FIBER
AT DICKIES ARENA

W ith  its  soaring  roof  and  its  high-

end cosmetic finishes, Fort Worth’s
new Dickies Arena will be a won-
der to look at when it opens for
events later this fall.

But what may be even more impressive, certainly from
an IT perspective, is something you can’t see: The single,
converged fiber network that supports all network opera-
tions, including the cellular DAS, the arena Wi-Fi and the
IPTV operations, in an orderly, future-proofed way.

Built by AmpThink for the arena, the network is a de-
parture  from  what  has  long  been  the  norm  in  venue  IT
deployments,  where  multiple  service  providers  typically
build  their  own  networks,  with  multiple  cabling  systems
competing for conduit space. At Dickies Arena, AmpThink
was able to control the fiber systems to follow a single, spe-
cific path, allowing the company to save costs and space
for the client while building out a system with enough extra
capacity to handle future needs for bandwidth, according to
AmpThink.

“This is really our master class [on stadium network de-
sign],” said AmpThink president Bill Anderson, during a re-
cent MSR visit and tour of the almost-ready arena. If you’re
not familiar with the Dickies Arena story, the arena is part
of a public-private venture between the city of Fort Worth
and a consortium of investors and donors led by local Fort
Worth philanthropist Ed Bass. Though it doesn’t have a pro-
fessional basketball or hockey tenant, the NBA-sized venue
will fill an arena-sized need for events in the growing Fort

Worth area, while also  serving as the new home for the
Fort Worth Stock Show and Rodeo. The venue is scheduled
to open this November.

Following the lead of AT&T Stadium, where high-end
finishes were a hallmark of Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry
Jones’  influence,  Dickies  Arena  appears  to  take  cosmetic
matters a full step further, with intricate tile flooring and
art-quality finishes on areas like stairway handrails and bar
facades. In an early September walkaround while workers
were still completing finishing touches like polishing con-
crete  floors  to  make  the  surfaces  shine,  MSR  also  got  to
see the results of owners’ requests of “not having a single
cellular or Wi-Fi antenna visible,” according to AmpThink’s
Anderson.

No fiber allowed outside of the
single path

In  the  suite  and  concourse  areas,  for  example,  Wi-Fi
APs and DAS antennas are hidden behind ceiling panels,
with no electronics in sight. But what’s even more impres-
sive  from  an  engineering  and  construction  standpoint  is
what’s happening further down the network path from the
endpoints, where all cable and fiber follows a structured
pathway,  first  to  an  IDF  and  then  back  to  the  head  end
rooms in the arena’s basement.

“No fiber is allowed to follow a path that doesn’t tie to
an IDF, or directly to the head end,” said Anderson. “And
we didn’t allow DAS vendors to be outside the closet. It’s
the venue’s fiber network. Nobody else could come in and
build their own.”

L ooking from the end of the project back, it’s

clear why you might want to pursue such a
path: With a single, converged network, de-
sign and planning and eventually operations
are  streamlined,  since  there  aren’t  multiple
infrastructures to deploy and maintain. The
conditions also allowed AmpThink to fully pre-design and
perform many construction techniques like splicing and ca-
ble  measurement  and  cutting  beforehand  –  according  to
Anderson, there was not a single fiber termination done in
the field.

“For venues it used to be, use the ‘brute force’ meth-
od  and  just  go  figure  it  out  in  the  field,”  Anderson  said.
At Dickies Arena, that method simply wasn’t the case. In
addition to fiber cabling and splicing work, AmpThink also
built  many  custom  enclosures  (the  company  has  a  large
machine shop at its Dallas-area headquarters where it can
design and manufacture parts like metal wiring boxes and
the  plastic  enclosures  it  uses  for  stadium  Wi-Fi  and  DAS
deployments) to simplify installation while complying with
the strict aesthetic requirements.

“AmpThink helped us think proactively so we are pre-
pared to build on this solid foundation for the future,” said
Matt Homan, president and general manager of Trail Drive
Management  Corp  (TDMC),  the  not-for-profit  operating

entity  for  Dickies  Arena.  “This  has  allowed  us  to  have  a
much more cost-effective approach, which is important for
us  as  a  501c3  organization  operating  Dickies  Arena.  The
AmpThink team has done a phenomenal job of assisting
with the architectural integrity of the building to ensure that
no Wi-Fi or DAS antennas were seen.”

Jeff Alexander, senior vice president at ExteNet Systems,
said Dickies Arena was the first time ExteNet ever partici-
pated in a converged network design for a large public ven-
ue. But Alexander also said ExteNet, which is responsible
for the DAS design and 5G cellular installations at Dickies
Arena, had years of experience in situations where service
providers had to work together.

“Most [other] DAS deployments give no consideration
for Wi-Fi, or anything else,” said Alexander in a phone in-
terview. “Given ExteNet’s experience and our track record,
these  are  things  we  were  forced  to  think  about  10  years
ago.”

According to Alexander, the directive to work with a
single converged fiber network wasn’t “harder” than a reg-
ular installation.

“It was unique,” Alexander said of the Dickies Arena in-
stallation experience. “It made us think of things we hadn’t

thought about, and challenged us to consider other things
than the typical DAS installation, which isn’t a bad thing. I
consider it a success.”

At Dickies Arena, the DAS uses the Corning ONE DAS
hardware system with approximately 500 active antennas
in 12 zones for the DAS.

As future-proofed as possible

As part of the overall fiber network design, AmpThink’s
Anderson said the company maximized capacity through-
out the building, with hundreds of extra fiber strands avail-
able to support future capacity needs. By using optical fiber
with hundreds of strands wound together – including some
stretches with 864 different fiber strands inside a single ca-
ble – AmpThink actually saved time, money and space by
preventing the need for additional infrastructure or future
cable pulls.

“The bulk of the cost [of fiber deployments] is the la-
bor to pull the fiber,” Anderson said. By using large-bundle
fiber, Anderson said AmpThink was able to drive the cost
per strand to “a very low number,” while also clearing con-
duit space since a large-bundle fiber strand saves a huge
amount of space when compared to multiple smaller-bun-

dle strands which must each have their own insulation.

  While  ExteNet’s  Alexander  contends  that  no  network
design can ever be truly “future-proofed” – if you ask him
he will tell you a story about a large sports venue where Ex-
teNet is currently replacing 864-strand fiber put in 5 years
ago with 1,728-strand fiber – he does agree that putting in
as much fiber as the design and cost allows buys a venue
time to support the always-growing demand for bandwidth.

“The industry is full of venues that didn’t do that, and
12 months later they’re expanding their fiber plant,” Alex-
ander said. AmpThink’s Anderson noted that even during
the arena’s construction, there were demands for additional
fiber – such as for a densification in the LED ribbon boards
– that were easily addressed.

“People came back to us, and said they needed more
fiber, and we had it to give to them, no problem,” Ander-
son said. “It didn’t cost us a lot to do it [add in more fiber
strands]. It’s a model everyone should look at.” –MSR–

THE NEW STADIUM’S HIGH-END FINISHES, FAN-FRIENDLY AMENITIES

MANY TRIPLE-A TEAMS, BUT THE BIG LEAGUES AS WELL

 MAJOR-LEAGUE

BALLPARK

  Maybe for some late-night behavior, the old “What
happens in Vegas stays in Vegas” rule still applies...

B ut  when  it  comes  to  minor-league

baseball, the tale of what’s happening
at Las Vegas Ballpark is being spread
far and wide, as the high-end finishes,
fan-friendly amenities and high-defini-
tion Wi-Fi network at the new venue
are the talk not only of many Triple-A teams, but of other
sports and possibly even Major League Baseball as well.

The $150 million ballpark, which opened this season
in  the  Vegas  suburb  of  Summerlin,  is  the  new  shining
jewel in minor-league baseball, with features like a huge
video  screen,  party  porches  and  club-level  suites  that
feel more major-league than minor. So far the facility has
been a smash hit with Vegas baseball fans, setting a new
season-attendance record halfway through the summer
and leading the minor leagues in attendance, despite the
fact  that  the  10,000-seat  venue  is  the  seventh-smallest
park in the PCL.

  During a quick summer visit for a game at the park,
Mobile  Sports  Report  found  that  the  fan-facing  Wi-Fi
network  was  at  the  same  quality  level  as  all  the  other
amenities,  with  speed  tests  in  the  60  Mbps  range  for
both download and upload at most locations around the
stadium. Built by Cox Business/Hospitality Network us-

ing  Cisco  gear,  the  network  uses  both  under-seat  and
overhead AP deployments, as well as some on poles, to
make sure all visitors have solid connectivity no matter
where  they  roam  inside  the  venue.  With  that  kind  of
bandwidth, it’s no wonder that selfies, videos and other
social-media  reports  are  helping  make  Las  Vegas  Ball-
park one of the worst-kept secrets in Vegas.

Major amenities for minor league park

“What’s  happening  here  isn’t  staying  in  Las  Ve-
gas,” said Branch Rickey, president of the Pacific Coast
League,  during  a  recent  press  conference  to  announce
that the 2020 Triple-A National Championship Game will
be played at Las Vegas Ballpark on Sept. 22 next year.
Rickey,  the  grandson  of  the  famous  baseball  executive
with the same name, noted that the new facility is “reso-
nating with players, coaches and executives” throughout
the league.

  While  Las  Vegas  may  have  an  outsized  reputation
for what happens with visitors to the legendary strip of
casinos, the reality of the larger Las Vegas is that it’s like
many other U.S. cities of a similar size, with families and
residents  who  have  been  hungering  for  quality  sports
entertainment. The instant success of the NHL’s Las Ve-
gas Golden Knights – who sold a ton of season tickets
to locals – is reflected in the embrace of the Las Vegas
Aviators’ new home, which is about as anti-Vegas as you
can get.

F ree parking, in a location far away from

the  Vegas  Strip  (Summerlin  is  about  a
20-minute drive from the casinos at rush
hour), and family-friendly features like a
grassy  hill  beyond  the  right-field  fence
where  kids  can  roll  around  –  or  ping-
pong tables on an outfield patio for kids who can’t stay
focused on baseball – make Las Vegas Ballpark a perfect
place for families. And the more adult-focused sections,
like the suites – or the party porches along each side of
the stadium and the outfield swimming pool area, pro-
vide easy entertainment options for companies or other
large groups looking to have a “team” event with base-
ball as a backdrop.

But in this day and age, no public sports place would
seem complete without good wireless connectivity, and
with its major-league Wi-Fi network, Las Vegas Ballpark
covers that base completely. With 380 APs covering the
entire park, MSR couldn’t find a single spot without con-
sistent coverage, including even outside the entry gates.
According  to  Cox,  approximately  130  of  the  APs  are
installed  under  seats,  a  trickier  than  usual  deployment
since the ballpark uses mesh seats in all seating areas – a
construction  that  could  dip  fans’  bottoms  closer  to  the
APs than a regular hard plastic seat.

  Mike  Fredericks,  vice  president  for  IT  development
for stadium owners the Howard Huges Corporation, said

the network was built to “major league standards,” and
our unofficial speed tests seemed to confirm that quality.
According to Cox, a 10 Gbps backbone powers the net-
work. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority
is the naming sponsor of the park, under an $80 million,
20-year deal.

As the technology sponsor, Cox Business/Hospitality
Network  is  the  exclusive  solutions  provider  for  the  Las
Vegas Ballpark, supporting both back-of-house network-
ing as well as the fan-facing technology.

Solid Wi-Fi everywhere in the park

If there is one place that venues seem to consistently
overlook when building out wireless, it’s the space just
outside  the  ticketing  gates  toward  the  parking  lot,  an
omission that can cause severe fan headaches in these
days of increasing use of digital ticketing. There was no
such problem at Las Vegas Ballpark, where outside the
outfield (east) entryway we got a speed test of 51.5 Mbps
on the download and 46.9 Mbps for upload. If there is
one  hitch  to  the  free  Wi-Fi  it  is  the  need  to  provide  a
name and a valid email address to log in, a registration
process that seems to be generally falling out of favor in
other stadiums.

  Once  inside  the  park  MSR  started  a  circumnaviga-
tion beginning with a path behind the centerfield wall,
where we got a speed test of 57.1 Mbps / 58.6 Mbps. We

  We  didn’t  get  a  speed  test  at  the  centerfield  pool
area – another private party had the space reserved – but
we did get a solid 43.8 Mbps / 57.3 Mbps mark at “The
Hangar,” the centerfield bar. And even though the con-
nectivity, architecture and trappings at the stadium had a
major-league feel, the between-inning promotions – like
kids racing on the field on bouncy blow-up horses – and
local sponsors (like a land-surveying company for home-
run  distance  measures)  made  sure  the  game  kept  the
charm that only a minor-league game can provide.

A t  the  press  conference  (held  earli-

er in the day of our visit) executives
from  minor  league  baseball  waxed
eloquently  about  the  park’s  attri-
butes.  “This  ballpark  exceeded  ex-
pectations, if that was possible,” said
Pat O’Conner, president of Minor League Baseball. And
while he stressed that he was no wireless expert, PCL’s
Rickey did say that having major-league connectivity was
an essential part of the minor league experience.

“If we are looking to find avenues to younger fans,
we realize that they are very more connected,” said Rick-
ey in a separate interview with MSR. “Our fans are reliant
on their mobile devices, and they can be used to provide
so much information about our game. Having great wire-
less is where we have to be. It’s essential to where we are
headed.”

At Las Vegas Ballpark, that base is covered. Feel free

walked directly underneath the 31-foot-high by 126-foot
wide Daktronics video board, the largest in minor league
baseball. We also walked directly underneath a MatSing
ball cellular antenna, which Verizon is currently using to
provide cellular coverage for its customers.

  Until the DAS gets fully built out inside the stadium,
AT&T, according to the stadium IT crew, plans to cover
the  stands  using  a  macro  tower  on  a  nearby  building;
T-Mobile  was  providing  service  to  the  stadium  using  a
COW (cell on wheels) unit in the main parking lot.

In both the left- and right-field corners of the stands,
Las Vegas Ballpark has some “loge” type seating, with a
fixed tabletop in front of several rows of seats. Under-seat
Wi-Fi deployments on both sides seemed to work well,
with speed tests of 65.6 Mbps / 68.9 Mbps in the left-field
loge seats and 66.4 Mbps / 55.5 Mbps in right field. On
the upper deck seating areas along both base lines are
party decks, both of which were hosting private events
on the night we attended; MSR was able to sneak in and
get a speed test of 66.5 Mbps / 67.5 Mbps on the left-field
deck; where Wi-Fi coverage was in part provided by a
couple of APs mounted on a low pole.
