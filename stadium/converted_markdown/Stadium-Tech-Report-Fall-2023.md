WHEN YOU
DEPLOY
TECHNOLOGY,
DON’T FORGET
THE PEOPLE

With the recent explosion of stadiums deploying

new technology in just about every phase of venue

operations, it’s easy to get caught up in the idea that

technology alone can help solve multiple game-day

pain points. But one thing struck me as I visited several

stadiums this year, watching closely how fans interact

with new technology: Without trained staff to help them,

many fans would struggle.

Since it’s clear that the post-
pandemic staffing shortage is still
a real thing at many venues, it’s also
understandable that owners and
operators have turned to technology
to help fill the operational gaps. But
in subsequent visits to stadiums on
live game days, it became apparent
to me that staffing is even more
critical than ever, especially as new

technologies require new roles for
both workers and customers.

TEACHING FANS NEW WAYS TO
ENTER VENUES

With the post-Covid attention being
paid by venues to try to eliminate
lines wherever possible, one of the
most-popular new technologies is
the walk-through security scanner.

Unlike traditional metal detectors,
which typically require attendees
to stop and divest themselves of
anything metallic, the new platforms
from providers like Evolv, Xtract One
and CEIA allow people to simply walk
right by the devices.

Most of the platform providers and
their customers have been saying
that the new systems not only allow
much faster ingress, but they also
have fewer “false positive” scans
than previous systems. They also
typically require fewer staffers per
stand, since there is no need for
personnel at every gate to look at
divested items or to hand-scan fans
who set off the alarms.

And while some providers of the new
technology are already quantifying
value by noting the savings on staff
resources, there is a twist on that
claim. Since the new systems also
require venues to construct an
entirely new way for fans to enter the
building, that also means completely
new training is needed for the entry
staff that do remain. With the Evolv
systems, for example, instead of
standing right by the gate staffers
are typically positioned a few yards
beyond it, watching a screen for any
alerts. Fans who do need additional
scanning must then be stopped and
directed to a secondary-scan area,
something that right now is set up
differently for every venue we’ve
been to.

What does this mean for staffing?
For many venues it means that while

you might be able to get by with fewer
numbers, those who remain will need
more training and more familiarity
with the new systems, things that
probably translate to higher pay.
And until the new systems become
second nature to guests, there is
also some hand-holding and fan-use
instruction added to the task list for
some of the security staff.

HELPING FANS LEARN SELF-
SERVE CONCESSIONS

On the concessions side of things, a
similar need for on-site instruction
is also apparent. At every one of the
stadiums we visited this summer and
fall we saw a huge need for staffers
who could help guide fans through their
initial interactions with the new self-
serve technologies being introduced.

While we did see numerous fans who
had clearly become new-technology
veterans, it’s helpful to remember
that over any given team’s season, the
large majority of fans will only attend
one or a small number of events.
That means that even at stadiums
that have had new concessions
technology for several years, like
Empower Field at Mile High in Denver,
at every game or concert there is an
entirely new group of fans who need
to learn the new technologies, often
in hectic situations.

Unlike at a grocery store, where you
might be able to learn a self-checkout
scanner at a somewhat relaxed pace,
at a stadium you may be confronting a

new checkout technology at the front
of a line of fans who are all trying to
get food and drink as fast as humanly
possible.

At Empower Field at Mile High we
came away incredibly impressed by
the performance of the staffers at the
multiple stands with new technology
as they clearly explained operations
(and in many cases, took over and
showed newbies how it worked by
scanning their items for them), all in the
concessions crush that happens in the
hour before kickoff.

What occured to us as we watched
the clearly veteran staff in operation
was that for many of the new-
technology concession stands, the
traditional process of bringing in
temporary concessions help (like
school groups or others who would
work as part of a fundraiser) may not
work very well. Like the new entry
technology, the new concessions
systems also allow stands to operate
with fewer staff -- but the staffers
who are working need to be more
highly trained and more able to handle
much different tasks.

THE JOBS THAT CAN’T BE
AUTOMATED

At one of my stadium tours this
summer, I took a break at the end
to enjoy a cold beer provided by
our venue hosts. As I sat at a bar
overlooking an NBA basketball court,
the bartender asked me what I did for
a living.

I explained it quickly, adding that I
was primarily interested in one of the
new things at that stadium, some
checkout-free concession stands,
one of which was right around the
concourse curve from the bar.

“Oh,” she said. “You mean one of those
places that’s taking away my job.”

I also heard another story this fall
from an executive at a company that
provides new concession technology
where he admitted that one of the
pleasures he takes away from a
regular game-day experience was
interacting with a “favorite” bartender
at a stand near his seats.

Whether it’s someone who knows
your favorite beverage and has it
ready at your usual time, or someone
who “pours a little more” to regular
customers, that person may provide a
worth that’s hard to measure -- but it
may be more attractive to some fans
than an automated drink machine.

So yes, it makes sense to pursue,
study and track the development and
deployment of more technology in
stadiums, since it is fairly clear that
such advancements improve the
experience for fans while also helping
stadiums on the bottom line. But in
that journey, taking care of the human
resources behind all those changes
needs the same amount of attention.

The linebacker-size Denver Broncos

fan walked boldly up to the new-
technology concession stand,
stopped at the entry, spread his hands
wide and said with a smile:

“OK, tell me what I need to do here.”

If you’ve been to a game recently at
Denver’s Empower Field at Mile High,
it would not surprise you that the fan
expected to encounter something
different when he went to purchase
food or drink. For the past few years, the
stadium has been a kind of ground zero
for stadium concessions technology
innovation, pushing the envelope in
search of friction-reducing systems.

Led by the Broncos and their caterer, Aramark Sports
+ Entertainment, the stadium was moving in this
direction even before the Covid pandemic. But the pace
of innovation accelerated once fans came back from
the shutdowns, with many more fans willing to adopt
new transaction technologies that put a premium on
social distancing.

And if all these innovations improved the game day
experience for fans, their enthusiastic embrace of the
new systems may have been even better for business.
In addition to allowing venues to operate stands with
fewer employees per stand, the new technology stores
are outperforming many traditional belly-up stands.
According to Alicia Woznicki, vice president of design

In Denver, Broncos fans became some of the first to
encounter optical scanning self-checkout terminals,
where concession items get scanned by cameras
instead of being tallied by a cashier. Empower
Field at Mile High was also host to some of the
first checkout-free concession stands, where
customers simply scan a credit card at an entry
gate, get what items they want, and leave the store,
with payment taking place online later. While other
stadiums were also testing checkout-free stands,
the Broncos and Aramark quickly went all-in on the
concept, expanding to the nine such stores found in
the stadium today.

And this season, there was another twist added:
Customers using the checkout-free stores could
enroll in a program that would let them use facial
authentication systems for age verification and
payment, for an even faster way to get food and
beverages.

In addition to more new technology, including self-
checkout kiosks and a program that allowed fans
to self-checkout via scanning items on their phones,
Aramark and the Broncos also brought some new ideas
to concession stand layout and operation this fall, with
new configurations designed to further speed up the
purchasing process.

NETWORKS FOR
A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE

CommScope is committed to advancing networks with

a vision for producing innovative technology that can

play a vital role in creating a sustainable future.

There are 20 Mashgin terminals in use at Empower Field at Mile High,
including four at this grab-and-go stand on the upper concourse.

Our take, after spending several hours watching fans at
different stands with different types of technologies,
is that the new systems do work well at speeding
up transactions, and can even add a little fun along
the way. While very new procedures like the facial-
authentication systems may take a little longer to catch
on, the ability of fans to watch other fans do things
that very obviously produce a faster transaction are a
powerful allure to try something new.

Watching our “big” fan at a gate to one of the checkout-
free stores was instructive -- the store staffer at the
front gate quickly explained the how-to process to
get inside (a credit card scan and an ID check). With a
smile the fan strode into the store, grabbed his items

and quickly left -- another satisfied participant in the
Denver concessions-technology experiment.

Next: We will break down several of the top initiatives
in place in the stadium.

PART 1: FACING A NEW WAY
TO ZIPPIN
Zippin, a San Francisco-based startup which is leading
the sports stadium market for checkout-free concession
stands, is now embracing another new technology
-- facial authentication systems for age and payment
verification -- to speed transactions up even more.

“This is the holy grail for us,”said Alicia Woznicki, vice

president of design and development at Aramark
Sports + Entertainment, about the facial authentication
trial taking place this season. Aramark, the catering
firm that runs concession operations at Empower Field
at Mile High, started its experiment at a few of the nine
Zippin stands at the Broncos’ home opener, and has
expanded it to the remaining stands as the season
progressed.

As part of Aramark’s focus on improving beverage
services, Woznicki said that checking a fan’s ID to make
sure they are 21 or older was the “last piece of friction”

increase in sales per stand and the fewer staff needed
to run a checkout-free stand. What makes them fast is
the combination of cameras and machine learning that
lets fans simply scan some kind of payment proof at
the entry gate, and then grab what they want and leave,
with billing taking place later online.

But at every checkout-free store, a staffer is still
needed to check customer IDs for alcohol purchases,
a physical process that is different for each individual
and can eat up multiple seconds between fans finding
their cards and staff doing visual evaluations.

authentication systems -- where participants enroll ahead
of time with some combination of proof of physical ID, and
sometimes payment information -- are becoming more
prevalent in society overall, from personal systems like
those found on the iPhone to the Clear lanes and the new
TSA checks at airports, which have introduced the idea of
facial authentication to many.

But in the stadium world the idea of having fans
register beforehand with photos of their state-issued
IDs and a selfie to allow them to enter stadiums or buy
concessions by just showing their face to a monitor
is still in its early days. Using software from a startup
called Wicket, teams including the Cleveland Browns,
New York Mets and the Atlanta Falcons have been
running programs the past few years where fans can
tie their tickets to a facial authentication program,
providing them faster entry to the stadium by simply
staring at a screen on the way in. Most of these
deployments also have special lanes for the facial-
authentication systems, speeding up the interaction
even more.

And last year, the Browns teamed with Aramark,
Wicket and a mobile-ordering software firm called

in the purchasing process, something that seemed
like a stop sign on the highway of checkout-free
transactions.

Like other checkout-free stands, the Zippin stores
have won rave reviews from fans for the transaction
speed, and enthusiasm from venues because of the

“The ID check was really bottlenecking the fast
experience [of checkout-free],” Wozicki said. “We
wanted to see how fast we could make it.”

That’s when Aramark and the Broncos turned to the
idea of using facial authentication for both payment
information as well as age verification. Facial

TapIn2 to set up a program where fans could enroll with
photos of their ID, a selfie, and payment data so that
when they wanted to buy a beer from a special stand in
the program, they only had to show their face to an iPad
screen for payment and age verification.

A key part of that solution came from a Boulder,
Colo.-based company called IDmission that has
years of experience of doing online ID verification for
banking companies. For the Denver Zippin stores trial,
Aramark is only using software from IDmission for the
facial-authentication lines, which are separate from
the regular Zippin entry lines, to provide an “express”
lane for fans willing to try the new system out.

After enrolling in the system, fans in Denver can simply
approach the tablet mounted on the entry gate, make
sure their face is centered in the screen, and wait a few
seconds for payment and ID verification. Then the gates
open, and they can walk right in, only needing to show a
staffer that their cans are opened before leaving.

On paper it might not sound like a big leap, but from
what we observed at a recent Broncos game, being
able to skip the number of variables that might pop up

14    STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   FALL  2023

STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   FALL  2023     15

from ID checks and payment verifications can provide
a huge improvement in overall transaction speed, from
half a minute or so to just a few seconds.

Sept. 17, we only saw a combined handful of fans using
the facial-authentication gates at all the Zippin stores
we visited.

The next trick for Aramark and the Broncos is to
get fans to try out a system that combines two new
technologies. While the existing Zippin stands at
Empower Field at Mile High are popular -- according
to Aramark, during the Broncos home game on Sept.
17 this year the nine Zippin stands saw a total of nearly
8,000 customers -- at every game there are still fans
who are new to the checkout-free concept and need
a little on-site coaching. At the game we attended on

Part of the low user total may have been because
the Broncos and Aramark had not yet sent out an
informational email about the new system to season-
ticket holders before the game. Other hindrances
included some unclear signage at some of the smaller
Zippin stands that made location of a different line for
facial authentication hard to find. We did, however, see
numerous fans in the Zippin store lines studying the
posters advertising the facial-authentication system,

and scanning the QR code for a link to the signup page
while they waited.

And at the biggest Zippin stand in the stadium, on the
main lower concourse, a clearly marked and physically
separated facial-authentication line saw several users
in the few minutes we watched. With no confusion and
no need for staff assistance, those customers were
verified and inside the store in five seconds or less.
Customers who went through the usual process of
scanning a card and showing an ID to a staffer could
see times of 20 to 30 seconds or more to simply gain
entry, according to several clockings we took while
watching in person.

But overall, most of the Zippin transactions we timed
were under a minute total from walking up to exiting.

And while the Zippin stores did have lines forming
outside them during the pregame crush, the lines
moved quickly, clearly serving more fans in less time
than the traditional belly-up stands that were nearby.

For the customers who had already embraced
the facial-authentication system, combining that
efficiency with the fast-pace shopping once inside
a Zippin store seemed close to the fan concessions
nirvana that venues have been seeking to provide.
While some customers will always be wary of using
biological information for payments, for an increasing
number of stadiumgoers, the convenience of fast
transactions apparently far outweighs the concerns.

Lots of signage helps fans negotiate the different interactions at Zippin stores.

checkout. Like Zippin, Mashgin allows venues to
replace the traditional cashier checkout with formats
that allow customers to select their own items, then
do the pricing and checkout with (hopefully) minimum
assistance.

Like other technologies that supported contact-free
transactions, Mashgin terminals got a big lift when
fans returned to stadiums after the Covid pandemic.
While previously fans might have eschewed self-serve
devices, in the return after Covid fans embraced them
wholeheartedly. Though exact numbers are hard to
come by, venues with Mashgin deployments generally
talk of big-percentage lifts in overall transactions and

PART 2: FLEXIBILITY MAKES
MASHGIN AN EASY CHOICE
FOR VENUES
Even before Zippin, fans at Empower Field at Mile High
got introduced to new concessions technology several
years ago when a curious machine appeared at the
checkout area of some stands. Instead of a staffer
behind a terminal, the new devices were a platform
surrounded by metal bands above and on the platform’s
sides. What fans were instructed to do was to put their
items on the platform, where they would be scanned by
cameras and would instantly show up on the screen of
the attached payment device.

Provided by a Palo Alto, Calif.-based startup named
Mashgin, the terminals provided a fun and faster way
for fans to get a few simple items, like canned drinks or
grab-and-go snacks, than waiting in long belly-up lines.
With devices now in more than 70 stadiums throughout
the U.S., according to the company, the Mashgin
devices continue to win fans both from attending
customers as well as from venue operations teams.
At Empower Field at Mile High, there are 20 Mashgin
terminals in use, spread out across six different
concession stands.

New venues embracing Mashgin devices this football
season include the university stadiums at Alabama,
Texas and Auburn. The social media team at Auburn
posted a fun video of the Auburn Tiger mascot showing
how easy it was to use the devices for concession

size and real estate used, the Mashgin terminals are
comparitvely less expensive and can be moved around
as needed to different stands, needing only power, a
network connection, and a flat spot to put the device on.

What the Mashgin terminals do call for is more
customer work than a checkout-free store, since
customers must still check out themselves. And even
though we saw some clear Mashgin veteran users
during our visit to Empower Field at Mile High, many
other fans were obviously encountering the devices for
the first time and needed staff assistance to complete
the checkout journey.

At one stand, we saw a Mashgin power user wave
off the offer of help from staff, and purchase two
beverages quickly, spending just 21 seconds to place
his items on the device, tap a card to the payment
device, open his cans and have his ID checked by the
staffer. Another fan at the same stand needed a bit
more help, with the staffer showing how the items
needed to be spaced a bit apart so the cameras
could pick up each one. That transaction, which
included the ID check/can opening and the fan
using their phone to pay for the purchase of two
beers and a box of popcorn, took 46 seconds from
when the fan arrived at the terminal. That time
was in addition to the time spent selecting items,
which we did not measure.

In other live-game situations we have witnessed,
where we have seen Mashgin terminals struggle a
bit is when fans try to check out a large number of
items that may not all fit on the pedestal at once.
According to the company, it is working on a fix
that will allow a customer to scan one set of items
and then press a button on the screen to allow
for another set to be scanned before entering
payment information.

In Denver, we also saw numerous short delays
during Mashgin checkouts when fans would get
confused by the overall process, especially since
the order of scanning, paying, having an ID check
and opening cans before you are finished seems

to vary not just by stand but by staffer. These delays
seemed less about the Mashgin devices and more
about the layout of the stands and the timing of the ID
checks.

Again, there are not a lot of statistics to exactly
measure performance but both company execs and
venues that have the devices are convinced that in the
right situation, Mashgin terminals can offer a distinct
time advantage over cashier checkouts or even other
self-scan devices like bar-code readers. And the ability
to move the Mashgin devices around from spot to spot
is likely a big selling point especially for heavy-use
venues that often have different event-day setups.

For now, the Mashgins are a valuable tool in the
Empower Field at Mile High concession quiver, with
more stadiums following that lead.

“There’s a place for all the technologies [in
concessions],” said Brandon Scott, head of sports for
Mashgin. “We’ve carved out a spot.”

per-cap spending at stands that use the devices to
replace traditional checkout formats.

The two other things that make Mashgins an attractive
option to venues are the devices’ costs, and their
deployment flexibility. Unlike the Zippin or Amazon

of thousands of dollars to deploy depending on the

PART 3: THE RISE OF THE
CHECKOUT KIOSK
If there is a newer concessions technology that is
fairly obvious in the how-to of its use, it’s the big-
screen kiosk. Popular at quick-service restaurants in
many places, self-order kiosks have been gradually
growing in use at stadium concession stands, including
Empower Field at Mile High, where the technology
has been in use for several years in a few different
iterations. At some kiosk stands, customers order and
pay at a kiosk, and then pick up their order when it’s
ready at a separate window.

But this year, kiosks are getting a new task: Self-
scan checkouts. Flipping the model on its head a bit,
Aramark this fall installed 39 checkout kiosks running
software from TapIn2, which specializes in mobile and
self-service solutions.

With big screens and a very obvious bar-code scanner
right below, the kiosks (manufactured by a company
called Olea, which builds a large number of white-
label kiosk devices) are being used at some new and
old grab-and-go stands at the stadium, including one
single stand that fills the space previously occupied by
three separate stands.

Top: Even with all the new technology, there is still a need for
hawkers selling drinks out of trays. Bottom: one of the hot-food lines
at the Mountain Pass stand.

Called the “Mountain Pass,” the three-space store on
the first-level concourse features two separate grab-
and-go lines with a wide offering of choices: Burgers,
build-your-own nachos with a bag of chips and sauce
in a cup, pizza,
fries, popcorn, hot
dogs and pretzels,
alongside coolers full
of various beverages.
In the middle of the
two walk-through
lines, which are
one-way passages
walled off from the
concourse, is the
checkout area, which
has 22 of the new TapIn2-powered scanners.

There, fans either use the bar-code scanner for items
that have codes on their packaging, or select items by
searching for them on the screen, a process already
familiar for those who have used self-scan systems at
grocery stores. Fans then pay for all their items with
the attached card scanner. Staffers are there to check
IDs for alcohol purchases, alerted by an LED panel that
turns red on the top of the kiosk when an alcoholic
beverage is scanned or selected.

According to Aramark staffers are also supposed
check receipts to see if the payment matches up with
what’s in the customer’s hands, but during our time
witnessing interactions we didn’t see any staffers do
so. Instead, the staffers (we counted six during the
pregame rush) were mainly helping customers figure
out the new systems, and reminding them to open beer
cans before leaving.

There is also an option at the Mountain Pass store for
customers to sign up for a web-based application that
allows them to use their phones to scan items as they
select them, but we didn’t see any fans using it during
the few minutes we watched.

According to Aramark, the Mountain Pass configuration
is already looking like a success. So far this year, the
combined-stands layout has seen an increase of 19
percent in per-cap spending than the three separate
stands it replaced.

We also saw some of the new kiosk checkout scanners
in use at some “Favs@MH” stands, which are basically
smaller versions of the same theme, with a smaller

According to Aramark,

Lloyd Ruch, vice president of client services and a
co-founder of the Pasadena, Calif.-based TapIn2, said
the self-checkout kiosks are just part of a natural
progression for the company, which started out
specializing in mobile ordering software (which is used
at stadiums including Empower Field at Mile High) and
then branched out into self-ordering and now self-
checkout devices.

PART 4: WHEN DESIGN AND
PROCESS ARE AS IMPORTANT
AS TECHNOLOGY: WALK
THRU BRU
The one thing that’s often not mentioned when
discussing stadium concession technology is that
the physical layout and functionality of the stands
themselves can sometimes do as much to improve fan
and business experiences than any technology.

Starting just before the pandemic hit, Empower Field
at Mile High and other venues began experimenting
with concession stands that looked much different
than the traditional “belly up” design where cashiers
stood on one side of the counter and interacted with
customers in lines perpendicular to the counter.

At Empower Field at Mile High the Aramark “Drink Mkt”
stands were among the first different ones to launch,
basically just spaces where customers would walk by
tall glass-door coolers, select what they wanted and
check out. At some of the stands, traffic came in one
side and exited on the other, keeping congestion to a
minimum. By building more stands with narrow menus
of either drinks or simple food selections, venues were

starting to balance out the lines that had forced people
to the general-purpose stands even if they only wanted
a beer or a bottle of water.

insights. “But what we found is that the model itself has
a lot of efficiency -- people can shop for themselves,
making their decisions before the register.”

“Walk Thru Bru,” an Aramark model that placed such
a stand usually on concourse walkways, was another
early design that proved effective. For Aramark a Walk
Thru Bru stand is a simple deployment that typically
involves a closed-in, single-file line space where fans
walk along glass-door coolers, select their items,
and proceed in the line’s one-way direction to the
checkout stands. While Mashgin devices were the
original checkout choice for the stands, according to
Aramark it has found through testing that it’s mainly
the slim-line design that speeds up transactions, and
not necessarily the checkout technology.

When Aramark started deploying the Walk Thru Bru
stands, “we loved pairing them with Mashgin and
Zippin,” said Scott McDade, Aramark vice president of

According to Aramark, that efficiency was the main
driving factor behind the concessionaire’s decision this
NFL season to remove “portable” beverage stands --
usually a square stand where cashiers sold either draft
beer from kegs or cans stored in ice bins -- from many
of its major NFL client stadiums and replace them with
the “Walk Thru Bru” concept.

According to McDade, the switch has already started
paying off. At the Chicago Bears’ home opener this
season against Green Bay, McDade said a stand area
where a Walk Thru Bru replaced a portable stand saw
80 percent more transactions than at the home opener
from the year before. At Empower Field at Mile High,
Aramark said Walk Thru Bru conversions “have seen
increased participation of 55 percent during peak

The ‘Walk Thru Bru’ style stands can use self-scan or cashiers for checkout.

at Mile High, we saw several Walk Thru Bru stands with
Bud Light branding, and another with Topo Chico as the
signage sponsor.

By lining up the stands parallel to concourse flow,
Woznicki said they can help keep concourses from
jamming up during peak purchasing times. And, like the
other Zippin- and Mashgin-powered stands, they can
reduce line pressure on the stands where fans may be
buuying specialty cooked items or mixed drinks.

Woznicki said the bet on Walk Thru Bru led Aramark
to eliminate the “TendedBar” automated drink stands
it had previously deployed at Empower Field at Mile
High. The TendedBar stands, which are basically large
trailers with multiple taps where customers select
custom-mixed drinks from a screen menu, are gaining
acceptance elsewhere, including recent deployments
at Darrell K Royal Texas Memorial Stadium at the
University of Texas and at Texas A&M’s Kyle Field.

“We just saw more traction with the Walk Thru Bru
stands,” Woznicki said. “What we hope is that [having
more of them] will make lines faster at bars where
people want mixed drinks.”

periods,” which allows those locations to take on more
volume and reduce the size of lines at other stands.

Alicia Woznicki, vice president of design and
development at Aramark, said the Walk Thru Bru design
offers “so many benefits from a client perspective.” In
addition to the increased sales, the stands are easily
branded with cooler signs or printed designs on the
materials used to create the lanes. At Empower Field
