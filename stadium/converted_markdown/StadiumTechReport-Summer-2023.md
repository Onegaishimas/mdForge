LOCAL-PROVIDER
CONCESSIONS IN ST. LOUIS
LOOKS LIKE A WINNER

After just 10 home games it’s probably too early to
call it a complete success, but our impression so far
is that the 100 percent local-provider concessions
operation at CityPark in St. Louis looks like a winner,
with facets that other teams might want to duplicate
at their own venues.

To us, the all-in combination

of great local food
and forward-looking
technologies is a perfect marriage.
Even while MLS expansion team
St. Louis City SC and its food
providers work their way around the
inevitable first-time challenges of
the innovative operation, it’s clear
that the structural decsions make
sense and should be looked at as
examples of how other venues might
use technology to enhance the fan
experience -- without making it all
about the technology.

Here’s a quick take on what we see
that works in St. Louis, from our

in-depth reporting as well as our
personal visit to a home game in
June:

1. LOCAL FOOD WORKS

Bringing local food providers into
stadiums is not something new --
pretty much every stadium we know
has at least one or a few signature
local dishes, ones either from loved
providers from the host city, or
stadium versions of treasured local
dishes.

But having 100 percent local
providers, which is what CityPark
has, is (as far as we know), unique.
And we think it is a decision that
resonates beyond just the enticing

sights and smells of craft-style
cooking.

First of all, local food seems to
come with a built-in promotional
value, the kind of attraction that
makes people love small hometown
places or innovative tastes found
at enterprising food trucks. People
go out of their way to find the
good food they love, and making
it available in a stadium setting
means that fans who already know
the provider will seek them out on
game day, something that has to be
helping provide more concession
sales than normal.

Allowing the owners and operators
of the food establishments to run
the stadium stands (instead of
concessionaire staffers) also is a
great decision, since those people
know best on the hows and whys of
what made their food attractive in
the first place. While dealing with
stadium technologies, especially
CityPark’s order-ahead app, can
be a challenge, there can’t be too
many business more ready to adapt
than small restaurants, which have
needed to overcome many hurdles
in the past few years just to survive.

And even if fans have never heard
about the providers before, the
fantastic presentation at most of
the stands at CityPark provides an
instant lure to a hungry eventgoer.
Enthusiastic operators smashing
down fresh ground beef onto a grill
sizzling with burgers and bacon,
others rolling fresh hot tortillas

for tacos are easy enticements
for fans to order more. And the
integration of technologies like the
order-ahead app and checkout-free
stands means that even at the most
desirable stands, lines never get
too long. And if one line is too long,
there are many more local choices
to pick from, not just one or two
alternatives to the sometimes bland
stadium fare.

2: FIND THE RIGHT TECH FOR THE
SITUATION

Like venues everywhere else,
CityPark is still working its way
through trial and error to find
the right technology fit for each
separate food provider. But out of
the gate, the team seems to have
planned well with its mix of different
technologies that provide separate
comfort levels for both providers
and customers.

One example is the team’s order-
ahead feature in the team app,
which currently has 10 providers
participating. According to the
providers we interviewed, figuring
out how to balance food production
flow between the instant app orders
and the orders coming from in-
person lines is a hard challenge.
But for those who are up to it, the
additional orders are also a business
bonus. wAccording to CityPark, the
app orders can account for 20 to 40
percent of a stand’s total orders.

The stadium’s three checkout-free
stands, powered by technology from

Zippin, are another technology that
seems to be growing in acceptance
from both providers and fans. While
some fans may take a few more
visits to warm to the much-different
shopping experience checkout-
free presents, others are already
catching on and checking out more
frequently.

According to the team, they are
currently seeing 33 percent repeat
customers at the checkout-free
stands, a stat that has the team
already looking to add more
checkout-free stands as quickly as
they can. One possible option is the
“Zippin Lane” configuration, which is
more streamlined and drink-focused
than the current stands, which all
have a hot-food kitchen area as part
of the offering.

3: CHANGE THE BEHAVIOR

Even the best food and the fastest
technology might not be enough to
overcome traditional fan behavior of
showing up at the last minute before
kickoff, or waiting until the halftime
whistle blows to try to get food and
drink. One of the big factors in the
food-program success at CityPark
seems to be fans responding to the
team’s efforts to get people to the
stadium early, and using the app when
possible to avoid standing in lines.

Just asking fans to arrive early
probably isn’t enough. That’s
why St. Louis, like many other
venues, is using enticements like

DJs and bands playing on a plaza
space outside the stadium during
pregame times, creating a sort
of team-sponsored tailgating
environment. By providing pregame
entertainment the team helps make
showing up early part of the event
-- and by having many choices for
great food available, it’s easier to
convince fans that getting there
early is a good use of their time.

Order-ahead apps and express-
pickup windows are another
innovation that many teams have
tried in some form or fashion, but
pairing them with high-level food
options and spacing them widely
around the stadium as St. Louis has
seems to contribute to a higher level
of participation. The fact that the
team also created its own app from
scratch to make sure the order-
ahead program worked at a high
level is also a likely contributor to
the program’s fast adoption.

While things like local food
providers and advanced concession
technology are in place at
many other venues, the level of
commitment to both sides of that
equation and the attention paid to
their combination is what makes the
difference at CityPark.

AN AMBITIOUS ORDER:

How CityPark uses technology to make its amazing
all-local, sustainable, concessions operation work

\ \  BY PAUL KAPUSTKA

W hat’s one of the

toughest tasks for any
soccer stadium? It’s
trying to figure out how
to get food and drink in fans’ hands inside
the narrow available windows before and
during the matches.

For any team, it’s a hard-to-balance
puzzle, trying to match concessions
performance with traditional fan
behaviors, like tailgating right up until
kickoff, as well as the short 15-minute
halftime break window.

But at CityPark, the new venue for Major League
Soccer expansion team St. Louis City SC that opened
earlier this year, the owners and operators added
more degrees of difficulty to their planned food
operations: Not only would the stands solely use food
from local providers, all operations would also be
highly sustainable, with a comprehensive recycling and
composting effort and no single-use plastics like water
bottles. And the program would also be very tech-
forward, with innovations like an order-ahead program
in the team app, self-serve kiosks, and checkout-free
stands, using technology from Zippin.

“Our philosophy for food in general was to connect in
an emotional way with fans,” said Matt Sebek, chief
experience officer for City SC. “Food is very communal,

as are sports, and if we wanted to do it, we wanted to do
it well.”

During a recent visit to CityPark, Stadium Tech Report
was able to see the concessions operation in action.
Like anything new there were some visible rough spots,
but overall it was well received by the sellout crowd in
attendance, who arrived early and jammed stands all
around the stadium, seeking food and beverage from
one of the 25 different local providers.

With many of the stadium providers being small
operations like food trucks or small restaurants, scaling
up to meet the volume and pace of a stadium crowd has
been a challenge, according to several of the providers
we talked to. But it’s also been profitable, they said, as
well as exciting, being part of something that builds on

the community feeling St. Louis City SC is clearly trying
to create with every facet of the team’s operations.

And as any fan knows, outside of the team’s on-field
performance there’s probably nothing more important
to the game-day experience than what kind of
concessions are available, and how easy it is to procure
them. Throwing a large number of highly different
food offerings and new-technology ordering methods
at a first-time provider base and a first-time stadium
crowd may have not been the easiest path to success,
but judging by a short impression of the providers and
consumers, it’s already a favorable part of attending a
match at CityPark.

According to CityPark, fans are embracing the
technology and ordering early, with 60 percent of sales
taking place before kickoff -- early proof that the plan is
a good one.

“I think our food program here was the hardest possible
way you could do it,” Sebek said with a laugh during
an interview just before a recent home game, talking
about the three goals of being 100 percent local,
environmentally responsible and tech-forward.

“Any one of those three things is hard, by itself,” Sebek
said. “And all three of those things working in harmony
has been a challenge. But it’s one I think our fans have
really embraced head-on.”

What did that mean on the food side? How about
hiring a “Chief Flavor Officer” who is a James Beard
Foundation award-winning chef? And using only local
food providers for 100 percent of the concession
offerings?

-----------      PART 1:  -----------

THE IDEA:
GREAT FOOD + GREAT TECH = A GREAT FAN
EXPERIENCE

For a first-time St. Louis visitor, it doesn’t take much
asking around to find a must-try place for dinner. Just
go to Anthonino’s Taverna, the best-known spot on
“The Hill,” an old neighborhood with family-style Italian
places to the west of downtown. The fact that on a
Tuesday night there’s an hour wait for a table means
that its popularity isn’t just a rumor: Local folks show up
in force for Anthonino’s eclectic and extensive menu,
which has not just the famous St. Louis classic, Toasted
Raviolis, but all the Italian favorites as well as a long list
of Greek options, a reflection on the owners’ parental
heritage -- an Italian father and a Greek mother.

Guy Fieri gave the restaurant a boost in popularity with
a fun review on his Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives show
in 2007 (Episode 9), and the restaurant got another TV
profile earlier this year on the Secret Sauce show on
A&E. But the place stands on what it delivers every
night: Great food in a warm, friendly environment.
The question is: How do you bring the essence of a
restaurant like Anthonino’s to a stadium, where a wait
of anything longer than a minute or two is out of the
question?

And why would you even try? While almost every
stadium these days has a small number of local or
specialty items, the balance of offerings at most stands
in most places is somewhat anonymous, just your
basic “stadium favorites” of hot dogs, nachos, popcorn
and peanuts. But according to St. Louis City SC chief
experience officer Matt Sebek, doing things the way
they’d always been done was not the motivating factor
for the city’s newest stadium.

“Fans wanted [the new stadium] to be the first of
something new, and not the last of how venues were
done before,” Sebek said.

NETWORKS FOR
A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE

CommScope is committed to advancing networks with

a vision for producing innovative technology that can

play a vital role in creating a sustainable future.

“We wanted variety, and the
best St. Louis has to offer,”
said Sebek. “And great local
food is so desirable.”

After spending almost an hour talking to bartenders
and other patrons while we waited for a table to clear at
Anthonino’s, Stadium Tech Report was able to experience
some of the taste that keeps people coming back to the
place. A pizza with roasted red peppers and chunks of
salami was superb, with a crust that was light and bready
on top but solid enough underneath to let you pick up a
slice with ease.

Inside CityPark, Anthonino’s stand is one of the three
stands using checkout-free technology from Zippin,
which allows fans to simply swipe a card or scan an app,
select their items, and walk out, with payment taking
place later online. The Anthonino’s stand is also located
directly behind the supporter’s section of the stadium,
where the die-hard fans typically stand all game and are
more likely to want the fastest transaction possible so
they can get back to cheering and chanting. That’s a lot
of pressure for a first-time concession operation.

Unlike other sports like American football or baseball,
soccer doesn’t have built-in breaks -- it’s just 90
minutes of action split by one 15-minute intermission.
In the past, we’ve seen soccer stadiums try to

accomodate fans by doing
things like setting up
pre-poured beer cups just
before halftime to try to
speed up the service.

New concession
technology, like the
checkout-free stores
or self-serve checkout
kiosks and terminals, have
helped speed concessions
operations overall at
many stadiums, with
more adopting the new
technology every day. But
almost every one of these
deployments we’ve seen
is a stand built and run by
a national concessionaire,
typically with canned drink offerings and maybe some
snacks or a few hot items. None that we are aware of
feature local food providers, who also staff the stands
with their own employees.

Add in the extra challenge of trying to integrate online
order-ahead requests made through the team app
(which 10 of the providers at CityPark currently support)
and you have a tall task for providers who are used to

While we didn’t sample the famous toasted raviolis
(at Anthonino’s they contain “ground beef, ricotta and
pecorino romano cheese”), we saw a couple at a nearby
table attack an order with vigor, dipping them into the
provided marinara sauce. With the friendly service
from the hosts to the bar staff to the servers we had an
excellent overall experience at Anthonino’s cozy street-
corner place. But our work question woud be -- could
you do all that on stadium time?

Fans line up to enter the Anthonino’s Taverna checkout-free stand at CityPark

taking customers in at their preferred pace. Safe to say,
there’s no room for an hour-long wait at the Anthonino’s
stadium stand. Instead, it’s completely the opposite.
Fans want those toasted raviolis now, so they can get
back to the action.

“It’s not without a challenge,” said Sebek of the local
providers’ performance at CityPark. “But their speed of
service is improving with each match.”

THE TECHNOLOGY POWERING THE OPERATION

Almost every sports team has some version of a
stadium or team app, usually developed by one of the
main third-party providers in the market. These vary
in quality and functionality, with most teams trying
hard to engage fans by supporting digital ticketing
and payment and loyalty services inside the app, with
varying degrees of success in getting fans to download
and use the programs.

To support its ambitious fan-connection demands
-- including its concessions operation -- St. Louis City
SC went its own way, building its own team application
from scratch to get all the functionality it wanted.

“Most stadium apps leave something to be desired,” said
St. Louis City SC chief experience officer Matt Sebek.
City SC’s app, on the other hand, was functioning a year
before the team ever took the field, bringing content
and information to prospective fans well before the first
game ball was rolled onto the CityPark turf.

By building connections through the content, Sebek
said that City SC now can claim that approximately
74 percent of the fans have the team app installed on
game day. And while digital ticketing was a “no-brainer”
inclusion, the “City Go” functionality of the app allows
fans to store a payment form for easy scan-and-pay
operation, as well as to order food ahead of time for
express pickup at any one of 10 different stands.

According to Sebek, the order-ahead option was a key
to the team’s strategy to “stretch the time” available for
fans to get food and drink. By adding an order-ahead
option, the idea was that stands could essentially serve
approximately twice the number of patrons, with one
window for walk-up orders and another for orders made
via a mobile device.

“The peak times for fans to
get food is 10 minutes before
game time, and 10 minutes
before halftime,” Sebek said.

“We want to extend those ordering times.”

So far, the concept is trending toward increasing
success. Some of that may simply have to do with the
fact that the app looks good and works well.

This page: A family group uses the self-serve optical-
scanner checkout terminals from Mashgin.
Facing page: Top: A look at the app’s order-ahead link;
Bottom: A sign outside one of the checkout-free stands.

While the providers we talked to cited fulfilling the app
orders as one of their biggest game-day challenges,
they also embraced the option, claiming its additions in
volume and revenue made it a great business decision.

“A small restaurant business might see 10,000
customers in a year -- we’re putting them in a place
that gets 22,500 people every night,” Sebek said. “It’s
an environment that’s a bit imposing at first, but we’ve
all been making operational improvements. Because
mobile is so successful, more of our partners are
looking to adding it.”

Next in the technology line are the three checkout-free
stores, which use technology from Zippin, the leader in
the sports stadium marketplace. If you’re not familiar
with checkout-free stores, here’s a quick primer.
Customers are allowed to enter stores by scanning
a credit card or some other pre-authorized payment
method. After entring the store’s gate they simply
take the items they want off the shelves and then exit.
Payment takes place online after they leave the store.

All three of the checkout-free stands at CityPark
have a hot food option available, as well as drinks and
packaged snacks like chips or popcorn. In several live
timings, Stadium Tech Report can confirm that even a
fan who wanders around a bit to check out the various
offerings can usually figure out what they want and
leave in less than a minute.

Sebek said the checkout-free stands are getting
“incredible numbers” for transaction times, with an
average of 90 seconds per transaction through the first
10 matches. Checkout-free orders on averge are also
125 percent higher than those at other stands, stats
that already have the stadium team in motion to bring
the technology to more stands.

“We’re going to find ways
to add more [checkout-free
stores] for sure,” Sebek said.

A number of other stands that don’t have order-ahead
or checkout-free options are still using advanced
technology, including the self-checkout terminals from
Mashgin, which use cameras to scan items placed

“The photos [of menu items] are professional, they’re
beautiful,” said Sebek. The order-ahead part of the app
also includes photos of the individual stands’ purveyors,
and a small company logo.

“It’s like something you might see from Panera,” Sebek
said.

According to Sebek, at stands that support the online
ordering, the online orders make up 20 percent of a
game day’s overall orders, with a higher overall order
size and bigger tips than in-person orders. Many of
those are placed before the game starts, as more fans
embrace the team’s urging for fans to arrive early and
take full advantage of the extensive menu options.
According to Sebek, 60 percent of a game’s overall food
and beverage sales now take place before the opening
whistle is blown.

on the terminal shelf, allowing fans to complete a
transaction without staff assistance. At some belly-up
bars CityPark has flip-screen terminals where staff
enter purchase information and then flip the screen
over for a customer to complete the payment part of
the transaction.

Overall, “it’s the perfect marriage, emerging tech and
great local food,” Sebek said.

-----------      PART 3:  -----------

THE FOOD: HARD TO MATCH ST. LOUIS’ MENU

Just scanning the list of food items available at
CityPark Stadium is guaranteed to make you hungry.
BBQ pulled-pork sandwiches. Smashed hamburgers.
Balkan beef wraps, which include onions, tomato, feta
cheese, cabbage, and garlic and chili sauce. Chicken,
pork or potato tacos. An Italian sandwich with ham,
roast beef, salami, provolone, lettuce, tomato, pickle,
onion “and a whole pepperoncini.” Mac and cheese with
jalapeno cheddar crumbles, smoked Missouri bacon
jam, and candied jalapeno drizzle. Fully loaded St. Louis
or Chicago style hot dogs. And we’re not even close to
being halfway through the menu!

At many stadiums across the country, there are usually
at least one if not a few specialty or locally produced
offerings. But by and large almost every stadium we
know of relies mainly on big concessionaire companies
to supply the balance of the game-day menu, with
a heavy emphasis on the so-called “fan favorites”
of hot dogs, nachos, pretzels and peanuts. Many of
these items are generic-type offerings, without much
pizzazz. Some even tend to the bottom line of the
desirable curve, like the pre-popped popcorn that you
can see being brought into the stadium well ahead of
game time in huge bags.

And then you have CityPark, and its all-local food lineup.
According to the team there are 25 different providers
staffing the 52 food or beverage outlets (a number that
includes suite and club services), and they all come
from in and around St. Louis, and all have some kind of
special taste that most likely you’ve never encountered
inside a stadium before. Especially not all at once.

On the night Stadium Tech Report visited CityPark,
we were able to briefly speak with “Chief Flavor
Officer” Gerard Craft, who owns and operates a range
of restaurants in St. Louis and has a resume that
includes awards like Food & Wine Best New Chef, Food
& Wine Innovator of the Year, and 2015 James Beard

Foundation Award-winning Best Chef: Midwest, among
other accolades. But what’s his favorite thing to do
these days?

“Having a chef [leading things] provides a higher level
of trust for restaurant people,” said Matt Sebek, chief
experience officer for St. Louis City SC.

“Being at the stadium is
awesome,” Craft said, taking a
brief break from supervising
some of the stands. “This is
more fun than running my
restaurants.”

Craft, who said he contacted the ownership team
about participating when he heard of CityPark’s plans,
brought to the party local connections and a level of
food savvy unusual for a stadium. Team execs said
Craft’s presence also made it easier to recruit and sign
up local food providers, who could speak with someone
who knew their business language, as opposed to a
stadium executive.

22    STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   SUMMER 2023

What Craft said he likes about his stadium post is the
fact that the team isn’t in it solely for the profits, but is
more about building an operation that truly improves
the fan experience.

“The team’s owners were behind us [the restaurant
providers] with every crazy idea we had,” Craft said.
“Every [restaurant] owner who is in here is so dedicated
-- we all want to make this a legacy for St. Louis.”

So that’s why a stroll around the concourse at CityPark
is a food voyage unlike that at any other venue. Where
else can you find all of the above offerings, plus local
ice cream, local craft brews, crab rangoon, empanadas,
Filipino pork belly, bao sliders, pizza slices, fried
samosas and vegetarian tofu wraps? All served by the
owners who created the offerings? The answer for now,
is nowhere else.

-----------      PART 4:  -----------

PROVIDER CLOSE-UP: FARMTRUK

One of the providers at the stadium is a business called
Farmtruk, which bills itself as “farm to table comfort
food,” with an emphasis on fresh, local, free-range
ingredients. Samantha “Sam” Mitchell, the owner, has
been running a food truck for seven years, “bouncing
all around town” in St. Louis, hitting about 200 events
a year. One of those events in 2019 was an away-
game watch party for the St. Louis Blues outside
their stadium, during their run to the Stanley Cup
championship.

“The Blues invited food trucks to their watch parties
and we just crushed it,” said Mitchell. That led to the
Blues offering a concession stand inside their stadium
to Farmtruk, which the company has operated the past
four hockey seasons.

When CityPark started looking around for providers
for its stadium food offerings, Mitchell said CitiyPark

scouted Farmtruk during hockey season and offered
them a spot. With the hockey-stand background
Mitchell and Farmtruk are perhaps the most-
experienced provider at CityPark, since she knows the
difference between a truck event and a game very well.

“It’s all about adapting the business, with multiple
registers and different line setups,” Mitchell said.
Farmtruk, which actually operates two stands inside
CityPark (one is smaller and focuses on mac and
cheese), is one of the 10 providers who are part of the
order-ahead service on the stadium app, a double-
edged sword that Mitchell had to learn to deal with.

Though Mitchell said that dealing with the Covid
pandemic did help Farmtruk in one perspective (“we had
a lot of practice setting up a mobile ordering system for
the truck”), she added that there is nothing in the food
truck world that can compare to the flood of orders
coming in pregame and just before halftime.

“The orders come in fast and you have to turn the food
around quickly,” Mitchell said. Even with parameters
put in place for the stadium (“a limited menu is the key”)

app-based orders. “It’s really impressive, the amount of
volume we get through the app,” she said.

Once a sous chef for about seven years, Mitchell said
she started the food truck “to take a break” but now
is happy about being back in the middle of something
frantic that is also profitable.

“When we were setting up the idea [for CityPark] we
went to Nashville and watched a game there to get a
feel for it, and it brought chills because the fans were
so intense,” Mitchell said. Now, that energy is evident at
CityPark, where getting good food is clearly part of the
game-day experience.

“It’s a blast because people are so excited to be here,
as they swoop by and get their food on the way to their
seats,” Mitchell said. “It feels like we’re setting the bar
for something.”

And for Farmtruk, it’s more than just fun.

“Financially, the stadium stands are bread and butter,”
said Mitchell, who estimates the stand operations
will add an additional 25 percent of revenue to the
Foodtruck bottom line.

“It’s going to be a good year for Farmtruk,” Mitchell said.

PROVIDER CLOSE-UP: BALKAN TREAT BOX

If there is an only-in-St. Louis restaurant success story,
it’s the one about Balkan Treat Box, an operation that
started as a food truck and now includes the truck, a
restaurant, and one of the most popular concession
stands at CityPark.

Co-owner Loryn Nalic, who founded the company with
her husband Edo, fell in love with the food Edo’s Bosnian
family cooked. A trained chef, she spent several months
traveling around her husband’s family’s region in that
country “cooking as much of their food I could cook.”

Samantha “Sam” Mitchell, owner of Farmtruk

there is still a juggling act that Mitchell is learning to
perfect, balancing the app orders with those coming
from fans just walking up to the stands.

“As soon as the gates open, I’ve got 40 burgers going
all at once,” said Mitchell, whose stand has one register
area for walk-up customers and another for those who
have pre-ordered through the app. And the latter, she
said, continues to grow each game as more fans learn
and adopt the service.

“The first game we were
on the app, it was like, ‘OK,
where are you guys,” Mitchell
said. “The next game, mobile
doubled my sales.”

While Mitchell admits that the twin crushes before
gametime and before halftime “sometimes cause us to
break the Internet,” she welcomes the addition of the

Upon her return in 2016, she and Edo started up the
truck and “hit the streets,” with the complicated task of
explaining what kind of food they were offering.

But Balkan Treat Box had a couple things in its favor:
The food was delicious, and the fact that St. Louis
has a large Bosnian emigrant population meant that
there was a starter audience who helped spread the
word. Soon after, local and national food publications
took notice, and Balkan Treat Box became, Nalic said,
“a national phenomenon,” with positive mentions in
publications including Food + Wine, Zagat, Eater, and
many local publications.

When CityPark did a local poll asking which restaurants
people wanted in the stadium, Balkan Treat Box was
one of the two top vote-getters, according to St. Louis
City SC’s chief experience officer Matt Sebek.

While Nalic is excited to be part of the stadium’s food
operations, she said it also has presented her crew with a
new slate of challenges. First is having to cook on electric
grills, a change since even in the truck Balkan Treat Box
uses wood fire. Second is dealing with the team’s order-
ahead app, which Nalic said creates a much different
interaction between restaurant and customer.

“It was difficult to tell people what Balkan food was,”
said Nalic, whose food looks delicious but has names
that are somewhat incomprehensible, like titles of
Ikea furniture. Cevapi, for instance, is the name of
an offering which includes “grilled Beef Sausages in
Somun, Kajmak, onion, side of cabbage salad.”

-----------      PART 6:  -----------

PROVIDER CLOSE-UP: ANTHONINO’S TAVERNA

For Anthony Scarato, the restaurant he opened with his
brother in 2004 -- Anthonino’s Taverna -- is something
more than just a place for food and drink.

“It’s an extension of our family,” he said. “It’s like coming
to dinner at our house.”

What was once just a small neighborhood place is now
a somewhat bigger place, with seating for about 200
guests “if we really pack them in,” Scarato said. Part
of what keeps a neighborhood place like Anthonino’s
Taverna successful for so long is a commitment
to quality, paying attention to small things like the
quality of the flour used and choosing more-expensive
cheeses for the flavors the owners know they need.

But can all that magic travel outside the walls to a
concession stand at a stadium? For Scarato the answer
is “yes,” mainly because of the owners’ commitment
to quality and the stadium’s support in making that
happen.

“We look at it [being at CityPark] like a catering event,”
Scarato said. “When we do those events, there are
certain menu items we won’t take, because they won’t
travel well.”

“Online [ordering] is tough because you can’t control
the pace,” Nalic said. “If you’re in the truck you are face
to face, you can control the line in front of you, and you
can see when things are off and you can talk to people.
For online, you need to be ready to serve right away.”

One way to cope, Nalic said, was to reduce the number
of items available at the stadium stand. Right now,
Balkan Treat Box only offers one main item (at the
recent game it was a beef or vegan kebab wrap) plus an
option for “loaded” fries, which are french fries topped
with beef bacon, sauces, feta cheese and green onions.

“You have to be smart about it, you don’t want to fall on
your face,” Nalic said.

At the game we attended, the Balkan Treat Box stand
had a full walk-up line immediately after fans were let
in the stadium, and the order-ahead pickup screen was
full of orders ready to be picked up.

“The volume is unlike anything we’ve ever done in a food
truck,” Nalic said.

While Nalic said the stand “has meetings every week”
with the stadium team on how to improve operations,
she said customers feel good about having both
options.

“It’s a cool app, and customers like the new way to
order,” Nalic said. “We’re all learning together on the
best ways to go.”

For staffing, Nalic’s standalone restuarant in St. Louis
is only open for lunch, allowing her to use restaurant
staff for games, which are mostly at night.

“All the owners [of the individual stands] all want to be
there [at the stadium], and we’re all there, every game,”
Nalic said. “People are excited to see you, and that’s
contagious.”

And like Farmtruk, Nalic said the returns are also
favorable.

“The volume is good, the pay is good -- it’s a successful
venture,” Nalic said.

“It’s great for the guests, and super easy,” Scarato said.
“I love the tech.”

Scarato also liked the fact that the new stand had more
kitchen space, allowing Anthonino’s to offer a chicken
sandwich alongside its gyro sandwich and its legendary
toasted raviolis.

“We sell a ton of everything, probably the raviolis the
most,” said Scarato. “It’s great to bring our namesake
items to the supporters’ section.”

Though the supporters’ section stands see perhaps the
fans who really want to get back to the action quickly,
Scarato said his team can handle the pressure.

“We have the skill set to perform and execute,” Scarato
said. “Our team now knows the rhythm. Before the
game and at halftime, they’re ready for the pushes.”

happy to show it off.”

stands, either to order or to pick up orders already
placed through the team app.

-----------      PART 7:  -----------

HOW DOES IT ALL WORK?

With still more than an hour and 15 minutes until kickoff,
the main concourse at CityPark was already getting
busy. Matt Sebek, chief experience officer for St. Louis
City SC, confirmed the perception with a quick check of
his phone.

“It’s 6:15 and there are already 5,000 people in the park,”
said Sebek, who was in the process of conducting a
short stadium tour. Clearly, the St. Louis fans had taken
the team’s idea of arriving early to heart, and were
already enthusiastically lining up at the concession

Getting so many people inside so quickly is part of the
stadium’s design. With the pitch dug down to about
40 feet below street level, the team was able to build
a tunnel to provide access for broadcast and back-of-
house supply vehicles without having to close off any
side of the stadium.

“All four walls are open to fans, we have no ‘back door’
by design,” Sebek said. “You can see, the flow through is
pretty good.”

Helping the quick entry was CityPark’s decision to use
the Evolv weapons detection system, which allows
groups of fans to walk through the security screening
technology without having to take anything out of
pockets or bags.

As we slowly walked around the perimeter of the main
concourse we could watch in real time fans pick and

Left: A look at the outside of Anthonino’s Taverna on “The Hill;” Right: Fans walk
through the exit gates at the Pie Guy Pizza checkout-free stand.

With a well-trained staff Scarato said his people know
how to bring the Anthonino’s flavor on the road -- if they
are allowed to.

“Some other places might not
let the restaurant operators
run the stand,” Scarato said.
At CityPark, not only does the
Anthonino’s lead chef preside
over every game day, the
stadium also provided all the
infrastructure.

“The stadium spent a lot to make sure
we have the equipment we need,”
Scarato said.

And even though the restaurant is
already somewhat of a local and even
nationally known quantity, Scarato
said that more exposure is never a
bad thing. In fact, though he said the
stadium stand makes money, he sees
even more value in the visbility gained
by being in front of sellout crowds
every home game.

“We wanted more visibility, and we are
‘the ravioli boys,’ “ Scarato said. “We
see new people who come to games
from out of town, plus our regulars,
who are happy to see us there.”

A recent change in location at the
stadium also worked in Anthonino’s
favor: When the original stand on
the second concourse level had to
be moved (Scarato said the fire marshal didn’t like
having a deep fryer on the second level), the team gave
Anthonino’s Taverna the opportunity to take over one
of the Zippin-powered checkout-free stands, where
people scan a credit card at the gate, select items, and
then leave, with payment taking place later online. The
new location is directly behind the most-fervent fan
location, the supporters’ section.

As a longtime part of the St. Louis restaurant
community, Scarato is happy for the stadium food
program’s developing success.

“So many stadiums just have watered-down hot dogs
and nachos where nobody puts any thought into it. Fans
just go there and eat the same old thing. Here, this is
the coolest thing ever. It’s the talk of the town, and it’s

staffers behind a glass partition as they smashed fresh
meat into sizzling burgers next to a pile of bacon. The

was playing quarterback at the middle of the booth,

choose which stands they wanted to get food from, with
lines forming quickly at spots like Balkan Treat Box,
Farmtruk and Beast BBQ.

While we were inside early we could still hear music
and sounds coming from outside on the stadium’s east
side, where a large plaza was hosting a
pregame party of sorts. According to
Sebek the plaza celebrations with DJs
or bands are just another part of the
“get here early” program, a promotion
that also attracts fans who don’t have
tickets to get inside the stadium.

Balkan Treat Box and Steve’s Hot Dogs,
Sebek said, were the two top vote-
getters in the fan poll about which food
providers they wanted in the stadium.
As such, both have unique east-side
stands that not only serve the main
concourse but also have windows
opening to the stadium’s outside, so
fans on the plaza can order concessions
without having to come in. Some fans,
Sebek said, just stay outside, watching
the game on a big screen or relaxing on
the nearby lawn across the street.

A small line outside the Pie Guy Pizza checkout-free stand.

As the stadium continued to fill up our
guided tour ended, and Stadium Tech
Report spent the rest of the pregame
time seeing how the concession technology worked
with a live crowd. Our first stop was Balkan Treat Box,
which by 7 p.m. (a half hour before kickoff) had a full
snaking line for walk-up orders and a full screen of
order-ahead orders ready for pickup.

One couple who picked up an order-ahead order said
the process was fast -- their order was ready 10 minutes
after they placed it when they got past security. The
only drawback, they said, was that the online menu
didn’t offer a specialty cocktail that the stand was
serving, which was available on the in-person menu.

Farmtruk’s main stand also had a full line of walk-

finishing burgers with condiments while also fulfilling
the order-ahead line, which like Balkan Treat Box had a
full screen of order numbers.

For Beast BBQ, a similar situation was in place at the
main stand, where a walk-up line filled the zig-zag
queue while a separate order-ahead pickup area had
a full screen of order numbers. Another nearby Beast
stand that offered loaded nachos did not have order-
ahead capability, but instead had a large walk-up line
stretching into the concourse.

On the checkout-free side, our first visit was to a stand
run by Wally’s, perhaps the most intriguing of the food
providers since it isn’t really a restaurant but instead
a business with two 24-hour highway service stations,

the closest one southwest of St. Louis off Interstate 44.
According to Craft, the Wally’s stops are somewhat of a
local phenomenon, with huge numbers of filling pumps
and a high-end food service with specialty sandwiches,
gourmet coffee and signature beef jerky.

At the CityPark stand, two employees wearing Wally’s-
branded shirts and caps were the perfect carnival
barkers, espousing the stand’s technology and its ability
to get fans food “within 27 seconds!” Inside, the hot
food window offered pulled pork and pulled chicken
sandwiches, along with Wally’s popcorn and Wally’s jerky.

We timed one customer’s journey through the Wally’s
stand as he leisurely looked at the hot food offerings,
selecting a sandwich, then getting a box of popcorn and
a beer. When he strolled out through the exit gates, the
total elapsed time inside the stand was 48.92 seconds.

Two other customers at Wally’s showed that while the
checkout-free stands have been in place since the

season’s opening, their method of operation are still new
to many fans. One woman was holding her items but had
to be coaxed by the employees to keep walking, through
the exit gates. “It just doesn’t feel right,” she said, laughing.
Another fan told us after she got out that the checkout-
free experience was “fun, but kind of crazy.”

On the other side of the stadium, we watched fans at
the Pie Guy Pizza stand deal with lines, a phenomenon
we’d seen at checkout-free stands in other stadiums.
Because of the way the overhead cameras work to
process purchase information, checkout-free stands
typically have a limit to how many customers can be
in a store at a certain time. So sometimes the stands
-- which are advertised as being able to eliminate lines
-- get lines anyway because of their popularity.

At the Pie Guy stand, there was a short line outside
the entry gates, and then another short line inside the
stand by the hot-food window, where fans were waiting

finished up our order with a smile, saying she was ready
for the halftime crush to arrive.

We took the food to a nearby stand-up bar, which
overlooked the south end stands, allowing us to watch a
corner kick while we enjoyed the fresh, juicy burger and
the crisp, cold brew.

While the halftime crowds didn’t seem as thick as the
pregame one (according to St. Louis City SC 35 percent
of all concession orders take place at halftime), we
still needed to stand to the side on the concourse to
make way for people trying to get more food and drink
before play started again. In another only-in-St. Louis
food moment we watched while a stadium halftime “fan
camera” segment ended up at one point showing a fan
in a City SC jersey, who also had a “toasted ravioli” mask
surrounding his head.

Our overall impression was that CityPark’s concession
operation was a growing success, one that will only get
better as providers and fans learn the process of how
to marry great food with technology that allows it to be
dispersed more quickly.

“What we’re seeing is that through 10 games, our plan is
already validated,” said Sebek. “If we just had belly-up
stands this wouldn’t work. We’ve found a way to flatten
the ordering curves.”

for slices to be ready. But once the fans got their slices
and other items they were able to quickly walk out.
One fan said the entire process was fast overall. “The
slowest thing was the time it took to scan my credit
card,” he said.

On the other side of a long belly-up bar was the
Anthonino’s checkout-free stand, where the hot food
window offered the toasted raviolis along with gyro
and chicken sandwiches, and even chicken strips with
fries. We timed a customer at the Anthonino’s stand
and watched while he took his time surveying the hot
options and then the drink coolers, ending up only

getting a couple beers. Total time elapsed: 43 seconds.

Like any new technology, some of the deployments
used for concessions at CityPark may take some
more time for fans to be truly comfortable with their
operation. At one stand we saw a couple consecutive
families struggle with the Mashgin terminals, eventually
needing a staff member to help them process their
transactions. At some deployments of the Mashgin
terminals we have seen at other stadiums, a close-by
instruction chart tells customers to make sure the
items are spaced out so that the cameras can pick up
the individual items.

“They can be tricky for first-time users but once they
use it once they usually get it,” said one staffer whose
stand had a couple Mashgin terminals.

With the game finally underway at 7:30 the concessions
crush subsided, and Stadium Tech Report went around
to the Farmtruk stand to get a firsthand taste of the
food before the halftime crowds arrived.

At the walkup line we ordered a burger and a local
craft beer, a CityWide Pils from 4Hands Brewing. We
used the stadium app’s ability to load a payment card
and were able to complete our transaction by simply
scanning the QR code into the terminal. Mitchell herself
