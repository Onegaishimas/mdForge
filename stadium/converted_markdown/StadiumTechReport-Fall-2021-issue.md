ALL VENUES SHOULD
FOLLOW THE RAIDERS’
LEAD AND ONLY ALLOW
VACCINATED FANS AT
EVENTS

When the NFL’s stereotypical bad-boy team with

its legendary rowdy fans found a new home in
Las Vegas, it was the safe bet to predict dire
outcomes from bringing “the Black Hole” to Sin
City. But who would have thought that the Las Vegas Raiders
and their fans would become the sports-world leaders in fan
decorum and vaccination sanity?

That’s the early take from the
Raiders’ first home game conducted
with the team’s new rules in effect,
which require all fans to show
proof of a Covid-19 vaccination
before they are let in the doors.
Instead of waves of people in gorilla
suits or spiked armor protesting
the requirement, the Sept. 13
Monday Night Football game
against the Baltimore Ravens at
Allegiant Stadium instead saw the
stadium filled with 61,756 fans (out
of a 65,000 capacity) who were
able to comply with the Raiders’

vaccination rules, in a process
that was remarkable for its lack of
controversy and snafus on both the
fan and team sides of the equation.

Requiring all fans to be vaccinated
to attend events is a move we
think all venues should replicate
immediately, both to help keep
fans safe and to help ensure that
the pandemic doesn’t shut down
stadiums all over again.

While the movement to require fans
to show either proof of vaccination
-- or in some cases, a recent
negative Covid-19 test -- to attend

live events is growing, our thinking
is that more stadiums and arenas
need to jump on the bandwagon.
In the NFL, the Raiders have
already been joined by the Seattle
Seahawks, the New Orleans
Saints and the Buffalo Bills, who
have announced similar policies.
A growing list of NHL and NBA
teams and arenas have reported
similar requirements, as have
many college teams, and the list is
growing daily.

But it’s not growing fast enough.
Too many leagues, teams and
venues are passing the buck to
local health officials, or politicians,
and either doing nothing or falling
back on the weakest protection
there is, the much-abused “mask
mandate.” That’s where a venue
makes a big deal about requiring
fans to “wear masks at all times,
except when actively eating or
drinking.” But here’s the truth:
Mask mandates don’t work in big
stadiums.

Yes, masks can and do make a
difference in virus transmission,
but unless you’re in a highly
controlled environment like a
restaurant or an airplane cabin
(where non-compliance can result
in a big fine and federal criminal
charges), they’re hard to enforce. In
a big stadium, mask mandates are
impossible to implement, especially
given the low ratio of potential
enforcers (ushers, etc.) to potential
abusers (thousands of fans).

Throw in alcohol consumption and
you are pretty much guaranteed to
have widespread non-compliance,
which some confused fans see as a
badge of courage or honor. I agree it
might be within the letter of the law
but to claim “I couldn’t wear a mask
because I never stopped drinking”
seems to miss the point.

THE MAJORITY IS IN FAVOR OF
PREVENTATIVE MEASURES

Lest you think that angering the
mask-adverse is a bad business
decision, you should consider what
happened at the first full games
this season at Buffalo’s Highmark
Stadium. In Buffalo, fans who were
complying with the mask mandates
got loudly upset about their
neighbors who weren’t, and whether
the teams will admit it or not, that
response -- in social media and in
direct complaints to the teams --
most likely carried a big weight in
the decision to make vaccination
proof part of attendance for both
places, going forward.

And while some fans might not
make the best decisions and
come to games even if they’re
not protected by a vaccination
requirement, venues are already
feeling pressure from two other
important groups to make
events safer -- the unsung venue
employees as well as the top-name
talent.

This year we have seen NFL teams
warn fans that lines may be long
because of “staffing issues,” a
problem that has caused snafus

at several big college venues this
football season. Never among the
highest-paying jobs, the part-time
gigs at stadiums on game day
suddenly seem a lot less attractive
when the bonus is potentially
catching Covid from an unmasked,
unvaccinated fan.

Big entertainment acts like Garth
Brooks and others are canceling
stadium shows because they
don’t want to play in places with
thousands of unvaccinated
attendees. Keep your venue free of
restrictions and you might end up
with a stadium full of fans but with
nobody to feed them, pour them a
beer, or with an empty stage. None
of those options sounds like a smart
way to go.

So why not support and attract the
majority, by making your venue a
safer place? The Raiders showed
not just great leadership but great
service to their fans with their
decision and their process. It was
a last-minute thing, but the team
really did all it could to make it easy
for fans to comply. They partnered
with Clear to make an easy app
available for proof of vaccination.
They had tents open three days
before the game at the stadium
so fans could figure things out
well before game time. They gave
away free vaccination shots in the
parking lot. What happened?

On the no-vax side, a protest
attracted about 40 people outside
the gates. Inside, more than 61,000
fans voted with their arms, saying
a vaccine was worth it. Even

more impressive was the Raiders’
claim that 6,000 of those fans
got their first shot in between the
announcement of the rule and
game time. If all stadiums joined
the Raiders, maybe we could get
enough unvaccinated folks to join
the rest of us and head this thing
off before it can hatch any new
variants.

Fans wait in line for vaccination screening.

Looking not too far back, teams
and venues helped lead the way to
safety in the earliest days of the
Covid-19 pandemic, opening their
doors and parking lots first for mass
testing sites, and then again for
vaccination sites, donating a lot of
space, time and energy to help get
the world on the right side of the
equation. It’s time now for venues to
take another big leadership step, in
favor of the majority of people who
want this pandemic to end.

W henever a new stadium opens, the

team running the venue knows that
an unexpected test of its systems
is going to come -- you just don’t know when.
For the Columbus Crew, there was one big test
of its bleeding-edge stadium-entry technology
package during the fifth regular-season
game ever at the new Lower.com Field. And it
arrived in spectacular fashion, in the form of
a big midwestern summer thunderstorm that
hovered over the stadium a couple hours before
game time, flashing lightning and blowing rain
sideways.

When the storm refused to cooperate by not
going away, the team was forced to keep pushing
back the time when it could safely open the gates
to welcome fans into the building. Even as the
rain still came down, fans were starting to gather
in big bunches outside the entryways, waiting for
the all-clear. As the delay crept closer to game
time, the big question was: Would fans be able
to get inside and to their seats before kickoff? Or
would there be lines, frustration, and anger?

The answer was a happy ending. As soon as the
venue opened its gates, fans flowed inside at
a pace not seen at many stadiums, at least not
those that were not just checking tickets but
also performing security screening. Thanks
to a deployment of leading-edge technologies
that included widespread Wi-Fi, self-scanning
ticketing pedestals, walk-through weapons
detectors and even a facial-authentication
ticketing option, the Crew was able to get its
crew of supporters inside in rapid fashion --
perhaps heralding what might be the new entry-
way standard for other venues to follow.

Stadium Tech Report was on hand for the rain-
soaked afternoon of Aug. 7, which turned into
a pleasant evening for a match with the clouds
departing shortly after kickoff in the game
between the Crew and the visiting Atlanta United

FC. During our pre-game tour of the brand-new venue
and before and during the game we got a good sense
that the technology team led by Brandon Covert was
delivering on its goals to make Lower.com Field “one of
the best venues,” and especially backing up its claim to
have “the best, fastest ingress that exists.”

For an estimated cost of $314 million, the new
downtown stadium opened this year on July 3, with an
announced capacity of 20,371 and a sleek, slick look-
and-feel that includes high-end premium seating and
club areas as well as a dedicated standing section for
the Nordecke, the Crew’s most-rabid supporters group.

FINDING OUT WHAT FANS WANT MOST

If you’re not familiar with the recent history of the
Columbus Crew, you can do a little research to learn
more about the drama from a few years back, when

Underpinning all the amenities was a solid plan for using
technology to improve the fan experience, an exercise
that Covert said was informed by a “research-based
approach” that included significant outreach to fans.

Experience Now and
Into the Future.

the then-owners threatened to move the franchise to
Austin, Texas, if demands for a new downtown stadium
weren’t met. In the end, it all turned out well for
Columbus Crew fans as the Haslam family -- owners of
the Cleveland Browns -- stepped up and took over the
club, with their own plans to build what is now known as
Lower.com Field.

“We asked what do fans want, what do you keep [from
the old stadium] and what do you replace,” Covert said.
Some recurring themes that emerged included more
self-service interactions, more food and commerce
choices, and also a desire for easier ways to get in and
out of the stadium.

“Ingress and concessions are challenging parts of any
live event,” Covert said. “Our focus was how do you
make it better.”

legacy of hand-punching paper tickets far behind.
But the challenges required to safely host large-
attendance events, which these days include security
screening, bag checks and probably soon vaccination
certification as well, can sometimes clash with legacy
issues like physical entry gates built decades ago.

And while many if not all teams and venues have moved
fully to digital ticketing, especially after the Covid-19
pandemic, the best practices for how to incorporate
more technology into entry procedures are still a work
in progress. Stadiums continue to suffer from the
last-minute ticket download problem, where fans wait
until they are outside a venue’s gates to try to load
their ticket into their phone, often causing stresses
on entryway wireless systems while impatient crowds
back up, frustrated that they can’t get inside.

And the fact that there is yet no worldwide default
standard among the multiple different digital-
ticketing deployment schemes, including near-field
communications (NFC) tickets, bar codes and other
wallet-type technologies, means that fans can often
be confused about which method is the best for any
given venue. Some venues are also still using handheld
ticket-scanning devices, which require training and a
somewhat unwanted human interaction.

The majority of venues today also still are using older
single-person magnometer devices, which require fans
to empty pockets and purses in a process that be a
big bottleneck for entry lines, especially so in adverse
weather conditions.

In the middle of the stadium’s construction the added
challenge of building during a worldwide pandemic
arrived, along with the need to address even more fan
concerns with touchless interactions and personal
safety. Like many other venues that contemplated
how to deal with hosting large events in the midst of
a still-active virus spread, the
Crew’s team focused even more
on eliminating lines, especially
at the entry to the stadium,
historically one of the biggest
pain points of any large venue.

As a new build, Lower.com Field had the advantage not
available to some older venues in that it could design
itself physically for easier access. In Lower.com Field’s
case that involves a large stair-stepped plaza at the
stadium’s southeast corner that is wide enough to
accommodate more than 20 separate entry lines. Solid
Wi-Fi coverage is provided by access points mounted
on light poles throughout the plaza, allowing the Crew
to set up the multiple entry lanes in whatever fashion
is needed. The ticketing turnstiles, from Austria-based
Axess, are battery-powered and Wi-Fi enabled, helping
with the flexible positioning.

Though the turnstiles may be different than those
fans are used to seeing, according to Renier Steyn,
managing director for Axess’s America operation, the
devices’ ability to handle any type of input -- including
NFC, scanned or RFID technologies -- becomes familiar
after just a few encounters.

“Like anything else it’s an education process,” said
Steyn, whose company is rapidly earning wins at U.S.
venues for the flexibility and power of its entry-gate
hardware. “By the third game, most people know what
to do.”

Steyn said one of the reasons more venues are
choosing Axess is because the company directly
integrates its hardware with whatever ticketing
platform the venue uses. That means a more efficient
ticketing solution, with no extra software for users to
navigate.

“Our secret sauce is that we have no middleware,”
Steyn said. “We don’t have a dog in the software race.”

USING YOUR FACE TO GET IN

And in a service free for fans who take a minute to
register ahead of time, there’s even an easier way to
get your ticket checked: You simply walk up to one of
the specially designed turnstiles that has an Wicket
kiosk mounted on the top, look at the screen and smile.

Using facial-recognition technology from a firm called
Wicket, the Crew now allows pre-registered fans to
simply walk up to turnstiles equipped with the tablet-

like Wicket Kiosk to have their tickets confirmed. Not
only is it a much faster process for single fans, but it
also appreciably speeds up the ticket-checking time for
groups of fans attending an event together, like friends,
families or even larger groups who are all sharing a
single-transaction purchase.

“If you’re enrolled
in the free Crew
Express Access
program it takes
about a half a
second for the
Wicket Kiosk to
recognize you, and
you’re in,” Covert
said. “And with one
scan, an entire
group can walk in.
With regular mobile
ticketing, you can’t
do that, you still
have to scan every
bar code.”

Stadium Tech
Report saw visible
proof of the facial-
recognition speed
improvements, as
a few families (who
had clearly been
through the process
before) followed
the leader quickly
past the turnstile.
One fan who said
he’d heard about the program through social media --
and who had a smiling friend follow him in through the
already-shorter entry line -- said the process was “easy,
and fun.”

Jeff Josephson, vice president for venue partnerships
at Wicket, said the company was “very proud” of the
Lower.com Field deployment, and the speed of entry

it is enabling. Unlike some other
facial-recognition technologies,
Josephson said that Wicket’s system
doesn’t actually store any facial
information anywhere on the device
but instead uses what it calls its
“facial authentication” system, which
uses artificial intelligence to map a
face digitally, and uses that code to
authenticate people.

So, if someone were to steal the
kiosk at a stadium, “they might get
a nice tablet, but there are no photos of people on
that device,” Josephson said. According to Covert,
Wicket did all the integration to pair the authentication
system with the team’s ticketing software, making
it a single-step process to look at the screen and be
authenticated.

And according to Wicket’s Josephson, for fans the
believing is in the seeing.

“The biggest challenge is always training people,
and you have to offer value and incentive for new
behaviors,” Josephson said. “But when you see the
shorter lines (the facial-recognition system users get a
separate entry line) and how easy it is, other people ask
‘how do I do that?’ “

NO STOPPING FOR SECURITY SCREENING

After getting their tickets confirmed, fans at Lower.
com Field then head through security screening  -- a
process that may confuse, yet delight, fans since there
was no gate to walk through, just a pathway bordered
by one of the new panel-style screening systems
that can scan multiple people at one time, including
families, with no need for most to empty pockets or
stop for any similar kind of procedure.

“About 95 percent of our fans probably have no idea
that they just went through security screening,” said
Covert, grinning as he watched the fast, steady stream
of fans clear the ticketing area to head into the stadium
proper. From our vantage point we watched some
people raise their arms (like you need to do in some

Above: The striking exterior of the stadium. Previous page: A Wicket Kiosk
gives instructions for the facial-recognition process, where fans simply

airport scanners), others look around, before most just
kept walking through.

According to Covert the screening system chosen
by Lower.com Field, called Evolv Express from a
company called Evolv, are “one hundred percent
game-changers.” From what we witnessed at Lower.
com Field, the Evolv systems lived up to their stated
goals of “streamlining the process and eliminating
the bottleneck associated with security screening all
while improving security and minimizing the need for
security staff to interact with fans.”

According to the company, the Evolv Express system
uses artificial intelligence to differentiate carried
weapons from everyday items such as smartphones,
keys, and other personal items, whether those items
are carried in by hand or concealed in a bag or pocket.
Security staff have multiple mechanisms to help them
ensure alerts are not missed; according to Evolv when
an alert is raised, a red light on the back of the weapons
detector is illuminated first, then a digital photo of
the person and an audible alarm are simultaneously
presented and signaled on a local tablet.

According to Covert the system typically only requires
five percent or fewer of fans to be stopped for an extra
search. During our visit most of the alerts we saw
seemed to be caused by umbrellas or purses being held
under rain jackets.

14    STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   FALL 2021

STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   FALL 2021     15

At Lower.com Field, security staffers watched the
alert process from the end of a corral area where fans
walked through. According to Evolv and to Covert
the Evolv system requires fewer security staffers to
operate, but those staffers do have to learn a different
process.

“You do need a strong crew to run the entire entry
process,” Covert said. But thanks to the self-scanning
ticketing system, Lower.com Field and the Crew
require fewer attendants at the turnstiles -- according
to Covert, what used to be a ticket taker for every entry
line now sees six attendants covering as many as 24
lanes.

“We’re really proud of the whole system,” Covert said.
“We get a lot of joy from the delight that fans have
expressed about it.”

GOOD WI-FI AND AN ELVIS SINGALONG

With the big crowd quickly ushered inside -- by our
estimates it took less than 15 minutes to completely
clear the southeast gate entry -- fans were able to
get to their seats well ahead of the Crew’s traditional
pregame singalong, swaying side to side while singing
along with a recording of Elvis Presley singing “Fools
Rush In.”

A message on both of the stadium’s large videoboards
alerted fans to the availability of free stadium Wi-Fi,
which was designed and installed by AmpThink using
Wi-Fi 6 gear from Aruba, a Hewlett Packard Enterprise
company. For most of the bowl seating the APs were
installed in under-seat enclosures. For the outdoor
areas like the plaza, a small pole-mounted AP was
used. In total the venue has approximately 615 APs,
according to Covert.

While the stadium’s cellular distributed antenna system
(DAS) was not yet active with carrier signals on the
day of our visit, the Crew is in the process of signing
contracts with all three of the major U.S. wireless
carriers. Verizon already had its automatic customer
switch to Wi-Fi working when we visited, and without

any manipulation our Verizon device connected quickly
to Wi-Fi once we were inside.

A few random speed tests of the Wi-Fi signal while
walking around saw one measurement of 39 Mbps for
download and 55 Mbps for upload (at the southeast
plaza area during the ticketing rush) and a 55.4 / 27.1
measurement in the lower bowl just before kickoff.
According to Covert the team has already seen games
with as many as 9,000 concurrent connections.

A GREAT START WITH MORE TO COME

As one of the original 10 teams that was part of
Major League Soccer when it was formed in 1996,
the Columbus Crew is now writing a new part of its
history, as an organization well ahead of the curve
when it comes to using technology to improve the fan
experience. Stadium Tech Report plans to cover more
of the venue’s attributes, like the cutting-edge IPTV
network powered by TriplePlay, and future plans like
mobile ordering and express pickup and delivery for
concessions.

Local fans should also see more amenities added as
the future unfolds, as one of the dirt parking lots in
the shadow of the iconic yellow “Crew” smokestack is
scheduled to become a mixed-use development with
residential and commercial properties. Such nearby
associated properties are a growing hallmark for
venues everywhere, as teams try to change stadiums
from being a drive-up and leave place to a gathering
spot where fans can linger before and after events, and
perhaps even walk right home.

Like the entryway operation, there’s a lot to like about
the new ways of doing things at the new home of the
Columbus Crew.

If you’re a Raiders fan, you are probably ecstatic about the new place

your team -- the Las Vegas Raiders -- can finally call home. And among
all the amenities stuffed into Allegiant Stadium, a solid fan-facing
Wi-Fi network stands out, delivering positive results from the first set

of full-attendance events.

Though it’s been officially “open” for more than a year, the new home of
the Raiders located just across the highway from the south end of the Las
Vegas Strip wasn’t able to host full-attendance events last year due to the
Covid-19 pandemic. But this summer as vaccinations helped beat back the
infection rate, Allegiant Stadium was open for business, including the first
Raiders game with fans, an Aug. 14 preseason event that Stadium Tech
Report was on hand to watch.

What we found was good, solid Wi-Fi signals at many locations in and
around the building, with some unexpectedly good marks in places tough
to cover. While the Wi-Fi will probably only get better over time as the
Raiders’ IT team has a chance to fine-tune it with fans in the stadium, it’s

already part of an attractive package that should help
keep the fan experience satisfying during the team’s
inaugural season.

and design and converged network planning directed
by AmpThink, the Raiders used an all-star team of
partners to reach the organization’s desire to provide
what Raiders’ vice president of IT Matt Pasco calls “a
top-notch fan experience.”

And so far this fall, while the team has done its part
with two exciting overtime overtime home wins to open
the season, the technology has also come through.

“Raiders fans deserve the world, and they finally
have a home to call their own,” said Pasco, in a mid-
game interview at the August preseason game. “I’m
extremely proud of what we’ve done.”

According to Pasco the Raiders ran all the technology
last year as if each game was a regular event, with
fully lit networks and programs for audio and visual
components. Doing so allowed the Raiders to do a lot
of fine-tuning that is always necessary whenever you
launch a technology-filled stadium.

And the fine-tuning paid off. Our speedtests during our
visit showed good coverage in many locations, with
Wi-Fi speeds above 30 Mbps for download outside the
main entry gates, a mark of 68.4 Mbps down / 83.9 Mbps
up in a club area, and 46.8 Mbps / 58.5 Mbps on the
upper concourse.

“We ran everything last year as if it were a full stadium,”
Pasco said. “We did IPTV, video, and tested the Wi-Fi
as well as you can without having bodies in the seats.
We were able to get through a lot of the issues you get
whenever you build something of this size.”

NEW WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY HELPS OVERCOME
CONSTRUCTION CHALLENGES

Pasco and the Raiders also took advantage of the extra
time before fans attended games at Allegiant Stadium
to integrate some cutting-edge technology from Cisco,
the company’s new Catalyst 9104 Wi-Fi antennas,
which have a much greater reach capability, able to

And during the past summer when the new Cisco Wi-
Fi antennas became available the stadium installed
some of those above the peristyle area. During our
conversation with Pasco, Stadium Tech Report was
able to get a Wi-Fi speedtest of 62.4 Mbps on the
download and 66.1 Mbps on the upload while standing
right next to the torch, pretty good proof that the new
Cisco gear was delivering as promised.

Statistics provided by Pasco’s office show the Raiders
recording 15.66 terabytes of Wi-Fi data for their
season-opening Monday Night Football game against
the Baltimore Ravens on Sept. 13. That followed a total-
tonnage Wi-Fi mark of 11.75 TB during a wrestling event
on Aug. 21 and just more than 9 TB during a college
game on Sept. 4.

Allegiant Stadium was the first place the new Cisco
gear was installed, and in one location the technology
was a perfect answer for a construction problem.
One of the hallmarks of the building is the north main-
concourse “peristyle” area, where the LED Torch that
honors former Raiders owner and coach Al Davis is the
central focus of a wide-open space where fans can
gather.

With no seats above the Torch and windows that can
open to the outside on one side, the space is alluring
and attractive -- and a complete headache for wireless
coverage, since the closest spot for antenna mounts
for Wi-Fi or cellular is way up on the roof structure,
some 90-plus feet above the floor.

“I asked about putting some Wi-Fi antennas on the
Torch but got ‘no’ for an answer,” Pasco said, laughing.

Instead, the Raiders turned to two new developments
in wireless technology to provide the coverage they
needed. On the cellular side, Allegiant Stadium installed
several MatSing Lens antennas directly over the torch.
With their patented “ball” shapes and ability to focus
tight beams of coverage that can extend much farther
than regular cellular antennas, the MatSings were a
perfect fit for the stadiums’ DAS. (MatSing antennas
proved to be so useful that the Raiders ended up
installing 27 of them throughout the building.)

The stadium’s public start has not been without its
hiccups -- during the wrestling event the building
was unable to process any concession transactions
for several hours due to a national outage issue that
affected one of the stadium’s payment-processing
services. While the issue wasn’t with any of the
systems controlled by the Raiders, the team still had to
deal with the fans in the building and compensated by
giving away food and beverages during the outage.

The Raiders also seem to be especially responsive
to solving other issues that inevitably crop up when
you open a facility of the size of Allegiant Stadium in
an urban area, including tweaking parking and traffic
patterns to help streamline the flow of fans into the
building on game days. During our visit the Raiders
helped alleviate the 100-degree afternoon heat by
providing cool-air misters in many locations outside
the entry gates. Inside, the stadium was cool and
comfortable, affirming the team’s decision to build a
domed building in the desert.

Technology also played a role in supporting a smooth
operation of the Raiders’ requirement that all fans
attending events show proof of a Covid-19 vaccination,
as a partnership with Clear provided an easy-to-use
app that allowed fans to scan their vaccination cards.
The Raiders also set up tents in the Allegiant Stadium
parking lots and opened them a few days before the
first regular-season game so that fans could either
provide proof of vaccination or even get a free vaccine
shot well before game day or game time.

“Having this building finally open to our fans is really
rewarding,” Pasco said. “I’m super proud of what’s been
built.”

MASSIVE POOLSIDE
VIDEO BOARD MAKES
A SPLASH AT LAS
VEGAS’ CIRCA

Stadium-sized screens at pool and
sportsbook attract sports fans to
new downtown Vegas resort

Sports fans who are looking for a stadium-

sized experience during their next Las Vegas
stay might want to check out Circa, a new
downtown resort with a massive poolside

videoboard and a three-story sportsbook with its own
huge screen, amenities that might have started a new
big-screen arms race outside of traditional sports
venues.

With the two big videoboards, owner and Circa CEO
Derek Stevens is tapping into a somewhat new trend
in the sports scene, the idea of large public “viewing
parties” that have most of the benefits of live sports

-- like an energized crowd and a great view of the
action -- with amenities you can’t find inside a stadium,
like a swim-up bar or being able to place bets from a
barcalounger in the sports book. According to Circa,
both the pool and the sportsbook have been popular
since the resort’s opening last year, especially at big
events like the Final Four and home games for the NHL’s
Las Vegas Knights and the Las Vegas Raiders.

“It’s Disneyland for the sports fan,” said Josh Francois,
managing director for the spectaculars division at
Daktronics, the display manufacturer that supplied
the oversized screens to Circa, which opened in late
2020. With a 143-foot diagonal reach for its 14-million-
megapixel LED screen, the videoboard at the resort’s
4,000-capacity “Stadium Swim” pool plays sports all
the time, often splitting the screen into many multiple
windows of simultaneous events. Even when a DJ is
spinning tunes for a poolside vibe, the screen never
switches from sports, according to Circa.

Inside the casino area the three-story sportsbook’s
videoboard checks in with measurements of 40
feet high by 120 feet wide, with a 2.5mm pixel pitch.
Positioned to one side is the betting oddsboard, itself
another screen that is 25 feet tall and 45 feet wide, with
a 3.9 mm pixel pitch. With a capacity of 1,000 amongst
its three levels (where you can find a free seat or pay
more for booths and lounge chairs), the sportsbook
touts itself as the biggest ever, but like with any arms
race it’s a good bet others have seen what Circa has
done and are already planning their own reply.

to gather there to get a game-day vibe even when the
game is not there or if they don’t have a ticket.

One of the more interesting trends that has grown
significantly is the “watch party,” many times a
gathering that takes place either inside or outside a
team’s venue when that team is playing on the road,
usually for an important playoff or championship game.
This past summer the Milwaukee Bucks may have
seen the biggest such gathering yet, when a crowd
estimated at 65,000 or more packed the “Deer District”
plaza directly outside Fiserv Forum during the game
when the Bucks won Game 6 to claim the NBA title.

Though the Deer District doesn’t have a permanent
big screen -- yet! -- other venues like the Golden State
Warriors have put big screens on the outside walls of
their new stadiums, with the idea that fans may want

For the past three years, the Circa’s owners (Derek
Stevens and his business partner and brother Greg)
have been holding their own big-screen outdoor watch
parties, at the Downtown Las Vegas Events Center,
a property they also own. “Those events were kind
of a proof of concept, to be part of a community, and
people packed the events,” said Steve Hamlin, a partner
with Tre’ Builders, a Las Vegas firm that managed the
construction of the Circa.

Moving that idea inside the Circa at both the pool and
the sportsbook was part of the sports-focused plan for
the resort, said Hamlin.

“Derek Stevens wanted it [the resort] to be the biggest
and best place to watch a game,” Hamlin said.

position of the Las Vegas sun and how that would
affect the pool’s board placement. Daktronics, he
said, also had to build custom modules for the screen’s
diodes since the owners wanted the board to be visible
from any of the hotel rooms facing the pool. Without
the custom gear, Hamlin said the board would have only
been visible about halfway up the 55-story building.
“Now you can see it clearly all the way up to the
rooftop,” Hamlin said.

‘MORE FUN THAN BEING AT THE GAME’

According to Mike Dini, Circa director of marketing,
both the pool and the sportsbook have been “a huge
success.” During the recent Monday Night Football
home opener for the Raiders at Allegiant Stadium
across town, Dini said the Stadium Swim was
“packed with Raiders fans,” something that happened
somewhat organically since the Circa pays more
attention to guests from out of town, Dini said.

That said, Dini also said the pool got pretty busy this
past spring with watch parties for Golden Knights
games, perhaps reflecting that the site may be
attractive to both visitors as well as locals who want a
place to gather when they can’t get a ticket or when the
team is out of town.

And while you’re watching why not go to a place where
you can also take a dip in a heated (or cooled) pool, one
that boasts some of the most advanced purification
methods around, not a small factor for a public site
that opened in the middle of a worldwide pandemic.
Or make a bet at a huge sportsbook, facilities that can
become like small stadiums themselves.

“People want to be entertained, and the idea of betting,
or being able to watch games while you dance and swim
has definitely taken off,” said Daktronics’ Francois.
“Credit to Derek and Greg for their vision, they saw this
before anyone else. It can be more fun than being in the
arena.”

TECHNICAL CHALLENGES FOR A SCREEN BY
THE POOL

While Daktronics has loads of experience installing
big videoboards in stadiums across the world, the pool
board presented a brand new set of challenges.

“There was nothing standard about it,” said Daktronics’
Francois. Unlike boards at stadiums, the Stadium Swim
screen basically runs all day long, since the pool is
open until 11 p.m. at night, 365 days a year. According to
Francois, some of the tweaks necessary to operate the
board included building catwalks into the back side of
the displays for maintenance crews.
