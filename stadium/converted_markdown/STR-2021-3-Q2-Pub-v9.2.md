FOR STADIUM
CONCESSIONS,
THE DIGITAL
REVOLUTION IS HERE

Goodbye, old-style walk-up concessions stand. I

won’t miss you. I won’t miss waiting in line behind
someone who is “buying for everyone,” trying to
remember food and drink combinations for the
family or the group of friends, then watching concession-
stand employees ring up an order, put food items together,
take payment and make change.

These things should have
disappeared from stadiums long
ago, but they persisted. If there
is one silver lining to the Covid
pandemic, it may be that the safety
and security precautions needed
to bring fans back into large public
venues -- which include being able
to feed and water those people
spending time in your building
-- have finally pushed needed
change upon stadium concessions
operations.

From conversations we’ve had
here at Stadium Tech Report with

industry thought leaders as well as
with stadiums and venues that have
been moving forward during the
past year, it’s become clear that one
of the biggest areas of technology
activity and experiments is around
concessions. Some of that has to do
with the need to keep fans socially
distanced during the pandemic, and
also to reduce human-to-human
contact as much as possible. But
it’s also clear that some ideas being
tested right now might well become
the “new normal” going forward.
And that’s good news all around.

6    STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   SPRING 2021

SPEEDING UP THE PROCESS

To be sure, the process toward
things like digital tickets and cash-
free concessions has been building
in the stadium ecosystem for some
time. In many such businesses
like fast food and airlines, kiosks
and mobile ordering systems have
replaced talking to another human
across a counter, perhaps with
some loss of personality but with
huge leaps in efficiency, safety and
getting exactly what you ordered
with much less waiting.

SO WHY DID THE PAST PERSIST AT
STADIUMS?

For the majority of venues who kept
the old methods, you could point to
the fact that they may have felt there
was no compelling reason to “fix
what wasn’t broke.” There might be
some grumbling about lines, but it
wasn’t a deal-breaker for most fans.
All was well, right?

Well, not really. For the non-
premium attendee, many events
in many buildings still had the
problem of old-fashioned walk-
up concession stands, where you
could spend a full baseball inning or
a good chunk of a football quarter
just waiting for a simple hot dog
and a beer.

It’s not like teams and venues
didn’t ever try to address the
issue of fans having to spend
active game time waiting for
food or drink (or for restrooms).
When the San Francisco 49ers
opened Levi’s Stadium in 2014,

the plan was to allow fans to place
a mobile concessions order and
have it delivered -- to any seat
in the stadium. While it was a
commendable effort, there were
too many things wrong with the
attempt, including the human
equation of just having enough
runners to deliver the goods.

There were also some new ideas,
like the line-length signs powered
by new systems from companies
like WaitTime, that began sprouting
up -- but what those technologies
didn’t really address was why there
were lines in the first place.

ENTER THE PANDEMIC

If there was one “simple” fix to
shortening lines, it would be
eliminating cash payments -- it’s
simple math, since it is far faster to
swipe a card than it is to pass bills
and coins back and forth.

While some stadiums, like
Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta,
actually took the plunge to a cash-
free concessions environment
before the pandemic, the balance
of venues kept the ability for fans to
use paper money

But the Covid-19 pandemic -- and
the safety measures needed
to safely allow fans back in big
public buildings -- made cash
transactions undesirable. In just
about every venue that opened
to limited attendance during the
past 12 months, all concessions
transactions were digital.

So far, I haven’t heard any widespread
complaints about the practice, which

leads me to believe that cashless,
or cash-free concessions, will likely
become the norm going forward. And
for fans, teams and venues, I think it’s
a good idea.

Sacramento’s Golden 1 Center and
Denver’s Empower Field at Mile
High take bold steps to reformat
concessions with an eye toward
grab-and-go functionality.

WHAT YOU CAN DO WHEN
EVERYTHING’S DIGITAL

KIOSKS AND EXPRESS OR TIMED
PICKUPS

From a venue owner’s or operator’s
point of view, all-digital payments
are a far superior choice, for many
reasons. Beyond the streamlining of
business processes that come with
eliminating cash drawers comes
better security, and faster and more
accurate business data tracking.

An all-digital environment also
allows teams and stadiums to more
closely integrate loyalty programs
and things like points with actual
payments; it also gives fans an
incentive or purpose to use a team
or stadium app, something many
fans have historically avoided.
Stadium app provider Venuetize,
for one, has racked up a few recent
customer wins (Globe Life Field, San
Jose Sharks) as teams seek to put
more transactional power into their
stadium and team apps.

Greater integration of payment
technology was one of the main
reasons behind the recent purchase
of app and transaction-process
software provider VenueNext
for $72 million by Shift4, a large
payment-processing company.

From a fan’s point of view, the
improvements in concessions
technology should be sudden and
noticeable. Already, we’ve seen
forward-thinking venues like

Concessions back-end software
and hardware provider Appetize
has been bullish on kiosk systems
going forward, with multiple
business wins during the pandemic
for new installations at places like
the Green Bay Packers’ Lambeau
Field, getting ready for the eventual
return of fans.

And while the shift might mean an
end to some desirable jobs, like the
row-by-row beer salesperson, the
idea of passing a cup of draft from
hand to hand down a row -- and then
also passing paper money back
and forth -- is something that is
probably never going to return.

As a young adult going to games
at my beloved home venue Wrigley
Field, the remembered calls of
“Old Style! Cold Beer!” evoke warm
memories and were part of the
great ballpark experience. As much
as I might miss that, I’m looking
forward to a future of returning
safely to venues and spending
much, much less time in lines.

applications in play in the new 26,000-seat

concessions and ticketing

venue, the team owners were not looking to

install technology for technology’s sake. Instead,

they said their tech mission was to “solve

problems” and create a unique, “frictionless”

environment that would make going to games

safer, easier and more enjoyable -- thereby

making West End Stadium that new “home”

where fans would want to visit again and again.

“When you’re moving into your first home, it’s

very exciting,” said Meg Ryan, chief marketing

officer for Cincinnati’s Major League Soccer

franchise, as it prepares to open its new $250

million home. Previously, FC Cincinnati had

played its games at the University of Cincinnati’s

Nippert Stadium, a 40,000-seat facility designed

for American football.

But when the MLS opens its 2021 season, the

“orange and blue” will have their own dedicated

stadium, one that at first glance from the outside

should add a sparkling highlight to the Cincinnati

skyline with its unique “vertical fins” LED lighting

system that will produce “moving” light displays.

(The stadium is scheduled to open with a game

against Inter Miami CF on May 16, 2021.)

If the outside fins and the inside video boards

from Daktronics are the most visible displays

of stadium technology, there is a wide range of

other technology deployments meant to make

the actual in-person visit an easier and safer

experience by eliminating “friction” points that

have long been a part of game-day sports.

‘We wanted to be innovative
from a technology standpoint,
but mainly what technology
does is allow us to solve
problems’

“We wanted to be innovative from a technology
standpoint, but mainly what technology does is
allow us to solve problems,” said Ryan, who joined FC
Cincinnati last year after previous stints with the NBA’s
Denver Nuggets and the Atlanta Hawks. And a lot of
those technology decisions, Ryan said, come from FC
Cincinnati’s fans, who were surveyed about game-day
visits prior to the construction of the new venue.

BEING SAFE AT THE GAME

Even before the Covid pandemic hit the world, the
plans for West End Stadium called for innovative use
of technology in all phases of operations. According to
Ryan, the team got a real “inspiration” of what its new
home could be when the owners visited Allianz Field
in St. Paul, Minnesota, during an MLS game against
Minnesota United FC.

Looking around that new facility, which was also
designed with an innovative technology strategy, gave
FC Cincinnati ideas about what its new home could be.
The team “experienced something that aligned with
where we wanted to go,” Ryan said. And while there,
FC Cincinnati also found the firm it would use to help
it get to its desired technology future -- Atomic Data,
the Minneapolis-based company that built and ran the
networks and other technology at Allianz Field.

Signed on first as FC Cincinnati’s technology owner’s
representative -- a role that would expand over time
-- Atomic Data helped FC Cincinnati in the evolving
journey of stadium technology deployments in the
face of the pandemic. According to Yagya Mahadevan,
Atomic’s enterprise project manager, that shift
included some distinct changes to both technology
deployments and how technology was used, in places
like stadium entry.

“When we opened Allianz Field we wanted to have
people taking tickets with handheld scanners, to greet
fans by looking them in the eyes,” Mahadevan said. “But
the pandemic has changed things. Now, nobody wants
to touch anything, so instead of hand scanners we’ll
have pedestals.” Mahadevan also said that Atomic Data

as Atomic Data’s role expanded from owner’s rep to
technology integrator.

“When something is working, adding a new partner
[as integrator] is not always the best solution,” Ryan
said. “Atomic Data really helped us make our ideas
happen, and we started asking how do we maximize the
relationship.”

On the Wi-Fi side, Atomic Data is following its game
plan from Allianz Field in Minnesota, where it installed
a mix of under-seat AP placements in the bowl seating
and overhead and wall placements in other areas.
Using gear from Aruba, a Hewlett Packard Enterprise
company, Atomic Data said it used about 350 APs in
the bowl out of a total of approximately 650 APs. All the
devices support the new Wi-Fi 6 protocol.

For the cellular DAS, Mobilitie is leading the
deployment, which according to Mobilitie will include
approximately 200 antennas, including eight MatSing
Lens antennas. On the IPTV side FC Cincinnati picked
Vitec to install the approximately 350 TV-size screens
that will be used around the stadium.

CREATING A GREAT EXPERIENCE

And not all the technology is wireless or digital.
According to FC Cincinnati, its new ultra-fan section
-- called “The Bailey” after a castle’s stronghold -- will

Underseat Wi-Fi enclosure

helped design in extra wireless coverage for the new
stadium’s main entry, where more than 60 percent of a
game-day crowd is expected to enter.

The pandemic also provided a final push toward
a fully cash-free and as contact-free as possible
concessions operation. FC Cincinnati selected app
provider Venuetize to help build a stadium app that
will support more contact-free
transactions, including an in-
seat delivery option that Ryan
said will be trialed early on.

“From the fans, one of the
biggest [previous] complaints
was about wanting to get back
to their seats more quickly when buying concessions,”
Ryan said. “They also wanted us to make sure the
experience was truly safe.”

ENABLING THE EXPERIENCE: WI-FI 6, DAS AND IPTV

To support the fan-facing technology, Atomic Data
first helped FC Cincinnati pick its key underlying
infrastructure providers -- and then also helped
with the design, installation and network operation

“We really want this stadium to be a community

Our conversation with

Kevin showed that
his 18-year career
at ME Engineers has

been almost a perfect mirror
of the growth of importance of
technology in stadium design and
build. Coming out of his hometown
college, Kansas State University,
Kevin started on projects where the
emphasis was more about “doing
low-voltage technology scope and
also power and lighting design.”
Starting out, he said ME Engineers
only had a couple people focusing
on technology
design,
but after
working on
his first “big
projects” for
the Arizona
Cardinals and
the St. Louis
Cardinals’
ballpark,
the practice
and his
responsibilites started growing.

When Kevin talks about his
background and growing up as a

kid who was interested in all kinds
of projects around engineering
and architecture, it’s easy to see
how he fit in well with the culture
at ME Engineers, where there is
expertise in numerous disciplines
including mechanical, electrical,
and plumbing design. And as clients
who work with ME Engineers know,
the company is not one that simply
signs off on a design and lets
outside contractors do the work.
Like many at the company, Kevin
-- who has expertise in telecom Wi-
Fi, DAS, security and A/V systems
design -- enjoys
getting involved
in a project early
on, working
with the owners
and architects
to “help them
to define the
technology vision
of the project,
and what’s
specific to the
project.”

What’s interesting to hear from
Kevin is how he has seen that vision
change over time. Early on, he saw

systems like security cameras
and stadium TV on their own
separate networks with their own
separate infrastructure. Now, ME
Engineers is at the forefront of the
trend of more converged stadium
technology builds, where getting
in early to influence the design and

of technology, including how the

overall impact and integration into
the building architecture.

STADIUM
TECH REPORT

deployment is even more crucial, he
notes, since it plays across all levels
of a building’s construction.

“It’s thinking about all those systems
holistically,” he says. “ You’ve got
shared technology spaces, [where]
you’re sharing a room with A/V and
IT systems and wireless systems.
How do they relate to each other?
What’s the impact on mechanical
and electrical systems that support
those?”

Kevin then talks about how all
the technology is “wrapped up in
my mind” under an umbrella that
also considers the impact on the
building architecture, and how
all that can be built so that all the
systems perform optimally. That’s
because, he jokes, nobody is looking
to buy anything other than the best

for their building.

“I’ve not ever once been in a room
with an athletic director or a CTO of
an organization, as we were talking
about wireless, where they’ve said
to me, I want the second-best
wireless connectivity,” Kevin noted,
tongue firmly in cheek.

Once a design vision has been
set, that’s when ME Engineers
gets to work, setting up budgets,
recommending products, and
“rolling up our sleeves” to enable the
vision “and turn it into something
tangible at the end of the day, like a
brand new sports venue.”

Kevin stresses his approach
is to listen to and work with all
stakeholders to define clear project
goals early in design, Then the ME
team focuses on developing a final

THE ‘MAGIC’ YOU SEEK IN
WIRELESS IS FREQUENCY
NEUTRAL NETWORKS

\ \  BY BILL ANDERSON

5G VS WI-FI ISN’T THE QUESTION

T here is a heated debate in the wireless

industry; 5G vs. Wi-Fi. Proponents of 5G claim
that massive speed increases and ubiquitous

coverage will render Wi-Fi networks obsolete. Wi-
Fi pundits claim that Wi-Fi has adopted the same
technology that underpins 5G using chipsets that cost
less because they are burdened by a lighter licensing
load from patent holders. 5G proponents tell us that
mobile network operators will have such a large,
robust footprint and delivered at such a competitive
price that no responsible business owner would build
and operate a Wi-Fi network. Wi-Fi proponents tell
us that 5G will never find its way into all of the devices
that rely on Wi-Fi.

from Deutsche Telekom. I had just spent 30 minutes
speaking on how Wi-Fi portals were being used in
U.S. stadiums to capture fan data and how that data
was being used to sell more tickets, merchandise,
and concessions. He politely asked questions about
a few statements I made and then left me with a final
rhetorical question. That question was:

‘When you landed in Berlin,
what did you have to do to
receive a phone call?’ The
answer was - ‘Nothing!’

Who are these proponents? In very simple terms, they
are the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of
5G and Wi-Fi technology. With few exceptions, the
loudest voices are suppliers who have something
to gain from the conversation. But look and listen
carefully. While the debate rages on, the same players
who lobby for one technology are quietly developing
capabilities to support both. Why? Because the truth
is that 5G and Wi-Fi aren’t competitive technologies,
they are complimentary; they are just different ways
to use spectrum.

MY ‘AHA’ MOMENT

Several years ago after speaking at a Wi-Fi Now
conference in Berlin, I was approached by a gentleman

“When you landed in Berlin, what did you have to do to
receive a phone call?” The answer was - “Nothing!” I
simply waited for my phone to ring. In the background,
that call might have originated on a desktop handset
attached to a Verizon network in New Jersey, which
was then forwarded to the AT&T network to which I
was subscribed, crossed the Atlantic on a fiber trunk,
passed across another European carrier’s circuits
before finding its way to a Deutsche Telekom tower
which lit up my handset. I didn’t need to attach my
phone to the local network, register with the carrier,
or provide any personal information. Everything
required to complete a very complex international
commercial transaction was invisible to me and
executed instantly. It was “Magic.”

STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   SPRING 2021     19

5G proponents stick with me, because my conclusion
probably doesn’t fall where you predict. Neither 5G nor
Wi-Fi address the future. Both are simply stops on the
journey to a frequency-neutral future. The magic of
my experience in Berlin wasn’t that I was attached to
a ubiquitous global network running on pre-5G (LTE)
technology, it was that the experience was effortless.
Wi-Fi can provide the same joy. My life is full of things
that are connected to the Wi-Fi network at my house.
My sprinkler system sends me messages to let me
know my grass is being watered. I can change the
temperature in my house from my phone. My scale in
the bathroom beams my weight to my watch, and when
I’m looking to escape for a couple of hours, my SmartTV
brings me a world of content. All without the slightest
effort on my part.

TECHNOLOGY IS THE PATH TRAVELED, NOT THE
DESTINATION

In spite of all of the marketing dollars being applied to
the “wireless wars,” no one wants Wi-Fi or 5G. What
they really want is inexpensive ubiquitous connectivity
that enables their life. And if you can look past the
debate about which technology is most efficient, least
expensive, most secure, fastest, easiest to manage,
and so on, you might realize that most users just need
a little data to be delivered reliably at a speed that is
sufficient to accommodate the experience they want
to have. Rarely is that more than 1 Mbps. For reference,
consider that streaming a 4K movie consumes about 7
GB per hour, or 120 MB per minute, or 2 MB per second
- a meager speed achievable long before Wi-Fi 6 or 5G
entered the market.

The problem has been that reliably delivering that
simple experience to everyone all at once wasn’t a
solved problem. The constraint was not the technology,
but rather the available spectrum. The solution over
time has been a combination of improving the use of
the available spectrum and securing new spectrum.

Today, we are at an inflection point. Governments
around the world are rethinking spectrum allocation,
opening the door for what may be the final push to
the fully wireless home, the wireless office, and the
wireless stadium. Someone will have to make the
decision about which technology or technologies they
should use. This will be decided by what it costs and
who is paying for it. But we can be sure that whatever
technology is selected, end-user happiness will be
greatest when the technical aspects of using a network
are invisible.

To achieve this experience, few would argue that
a single frequency band is sufficient. Successful
networks use a bucket of frequencies, shifting users
from one radio to the next adapting to the density
of the environment, the proximity to infrastructure,
system utilization, and environmental interference.
This is true for 5G and it is true for Wi-Fi. Within each
ecosystem, the experience can be seamless - “magic.”
However, when network boundaries are crossed
and the financial agendas of the network provider
are thrown into the mix, the experience can quickly
degrade from “magic” to frustration, and often leave
you angry.

The future of the wireless industry will be found
in a frequency-neutral approach to networking --
something we call “Frequency Neutral Networks.”
Devices will be equipped with a variety of radios
supporting a range of frequencies and multiple
technologies. Networks will consist of a diversity of
radios operating on different frequencies, at different
power levels, using a variety of antennas; each radio
configuration serving a purpose. As a device roams, it
will switch radios without interruption, traveling over
public and private networks without interrupting the
phone call, pausing a video, or delaying a chat.

Today, the software required to provide this experience
is in development. Passpoint (formerly HotSpot 2.0)
is a proven technology, used by vendors like Hewlett

OUR FUTURE IS ‘FREQUENCY
NEUTRAL NETWORKS’

For businesses of all kinds,
customer satisfaction is a
universal aspiration. In the world
of wireless services, customer
satisfaction is best achieved by

an experience that is frequency
neutral. Despite all the branding,
commercials and marketing,
most consumers don’t know or
don’t care about the differences
between 5G and Wi-Fi. They just
want their phones to work.

In a frequency neutral future, end
users will power up their devices
and just get connected to the
network that is best for what
they are doing, and where they
are. Software will decide who is
connected to what spectrum,
who will be billed, how the user
is authenticated, and when they
should be handed off to the next
network.

This will all occur in the
background without user input.

When users are asked what they
did to get connected, they will say
“nothing.” Magic.

PER-DEVICE
WIRELESS USAGE
STAYS STEADY AT
REDUCED-CROWD
SUPER BOWL LV

\ \  BY PAUL KAPUSTKA

Thanks to the reduced crowd size due to the

Covid pandemic, the total Wi-Fi and cellular
data used by fans at Super Bowl LV was well
below previous years’ numbers — but for

Wi-Fi the data used per device was nearly equal to last
year’s number, showing that fans are still using their
devices at the “big game” with gusto.

Because of needs to socially distance, this year’s Super
Bowl LV at Tampa’s Raymond James Stadium only saw
24,835 fans in attendance, much lower than the sellout
crowds usually seen at the NFL’s championship game.
According to numbers compiled by Extreme Networks,
fans who connected to the stadium’s Wi-Fi network used
a total of 13.97 terabytes of data, far below last year’s total
of 26.42 TB used at Super Bowl LIV at Hard Rock Stadium
in Miami, when 62,417 fans were at the game.

24    STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   SPRING 2021

The fans watching Tampa Bay’s 31-9 victory over the
Kansas City Chiefs live, however, used almost as much
data per device as last year. According to Extreme
23,766 devices were seen on the stadium’s Wi-Fi
network before and during the game. That works out
to a per-user bandwidth usage rate of 587.8 MB per
device, comparable to the 595.6 MB per user mark seen
at last year’s big game.

CELLULAR PER-DEVICE USE ALSO HIGH

On the cellular side, the bottom line from the big game
was a total of 17.7 terabytes combined for AT&T and
Verizon (with no numbers reported by T-Mobile), about
half the usage when compared to last year’s game.

Once again, it is impossible to compare apples to
apples as Verizon’s reported total of 4G and 5G data
used, 7 TB, is from Raymond James Stadium only.
AT&T, meanwhile, reported 10.7 TB of 4G and 5G data
used, but from an area “in and around the stadium,”

“It’s all about optimization of RF [radio frequency],”
said John Brams, senior director, venues, retail and
logistics at Extreme Networks, the supplier of the gear
behind the fan-facing Wi-Fi network in the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers’ home stadium.

When Extreme put a new Wi-Fi network into the venue
a couple years ago, it installed approximately 1,400
Wi-Fi access points, including 950 in the seating bowl
with most of those in under-seat enclosures. Like most
under-seat deployments, the network at Raymond
James Stadium was designed to use the bodies of fans
— known in the RF industry as “waterbags” — to block
wireless signals in a beneficial way, allowing network

with no exact description of how far out “around the
stadium” meant.

Still, taken at the highest totals the traffic pales
compared to that seen at the most recent Super Bowls,
where cellular traffic reported was above 35 TB for
AT&T and Verizon last year and somewhere north of 50
TB two years ago, when Sprint (now part of T-Mobile)
also reported numbers.

Verizon, which did say that 56 percent of the attendees
were Verizon customers (which if you use the official
attendance as a starting point gives you 13,907 Verizon
customers at the game), gave us a chance to do some
bandwidth-per-user math. Our unofficial calculations
show Verizon customers using an average
of 503 megabytes per user, a fairly solid
metric when compared to the Wi-Fi per-
device totals. According to Verizon, its 5G
customers saw an average download speed
of 817 Mbps, with peak speeds reaching
“over 2 Gbps.”

AT&T, meanwhile, claimed that its average
5G customer download speed was 1.261
Gbps with a peak download speed of 1.71
Gbps. However, since AT&T didn’t give us
any way to calculate approximately how
many customers it had at the game, it’s
hard to measure its speeds directly with
Verizon’s since there is no way of comparing
how many devices AT&T had to support.
T-Mobile, which claimed before the game
that it had done as much as anyone else to
support its customers at the game with 5G
services, does not report traffic statistics
from big events.

Tampa Bay was the first team to play the Super Bowl in its home stadium.

PLANNING FOR LOWER CAPACITY

Usually at Super Bowls, the challenge for wireless
providers is how to handle record-breaking demands.
This year with the reduced crowd sizes, the challenge
was in reverse, with network operators having to tune
their systems for the lower capacity.

operators to place APs closer to each other without
generating interference.

With fewer fans in the building, Extreme and the
Raymond James Stadium IT team had to figure out just
how to “tune” the network to balance connectivity with
potential interference.

While Brams said Extreme and the stadium had “five
different scenarios” planned for various attendance

Hometown fans cheered on Tom Brady and the Bucs to a Super Bowl win.

James Stadium got the latest and greatest equipment,
according to the carriers.

“This is all being built for the next Super Bowl, or when
the WWE [Wrestlemania] comes to town,” said Brian
Mecum, vice president
for device technology
and sports partnerships
for Verizon. At Raymond
James Stadium, Verizon
has put in place a
renovated DAS as well as
a “robust” 5G millimeter
wave deployment that
will bring the next level
of wireless connectivity
to cellular customers
across the board.

Verizon said it has also
installed 281 small cell
antennas to provide
permanent extended
cellular coverage around town, both in and around
Raymond James Stadium as well as in downtown
Tampa, the Tampa Riverwalk, and in nearby Ybor City.
Both AT&T and T-Mobile also said they had extensive
improvements in coverage to the stadium and the
greater Tampa downtown area ahead of the Super
Bowl, also with an eye toward ensuring that future
events with bigger crowds can still connect at the
highest speeds possible.

levels, from empty to full, the last few home games
during the Bucs’ regular season gave the network
operators a good testing ground for the eventual Super
Bowl plan. At the team’s last home game on Jan. 3,
there were 16,009 fans
in the stands, enough to
give Extreme a way to
test the eventual network
operation plan for Super
Bowl LV.

The limited crowd,
Brams said, “gave us a
broad sense of what we
would have to work with”
for Super Bowl LV. One
benefit of the under-
seat deployment is that
by being under seats,
the APs are less likely to
cause interference with
other APs, unlike top-
down Wi-Fi deployments where signals are more out in
the open.

In total, the venue had 1,522 APs ready for use at the
Super Bowl, with 1,439 permanent placements and 83
temporary devices. Some of those APs were mounted
on poles installed by Verizon to cover the parking
lots, blending 4G LTE, 5G cellular and Wi-Fi to provide
complete coverage for fans’ devices. According to
Extreme, the Wi-Fi APs at Raymond James Stadium
are all 802.11ac Wave 2 (Wi-Fi 5) devices.

PLANNING FOR THE POST-PANDEMIC FUTURE

According to representatives from the cellular carriers,
upgrades to systems in and around Raymond James
Stadium were made with an eye not just for this
year but for the post-pandemic future, when sellout
crowds hopefully return. As a venue that typically
sees a high share of hosting big events -- it has hosted
Super Bowls, college football championships and has
Wrestlemania coming in its near future -- Raymond
