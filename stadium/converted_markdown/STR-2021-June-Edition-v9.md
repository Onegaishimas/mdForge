It’s good to be back.

A safe return to sports means added technology and a robust network to support it.

From the smallest T-ball fields to the largest stadiums, sports are making a comeback.
As players, coaches, venue staff, and fans return, ensuring their health and safety is a
top priority. Technology that requires zero-to-minimal contact—like ticketless entry and
payment by facial recognition—is in high demand, but is your network ready?

Corning’s network solutions use hybrid copper/fiber cable to take power and unlimited
bandwidth to the far reaches of your venue. With this foundation, adding new
technology—and even 5G cellular—is simple.

FANS ARE
RETURNING.
IS YOUR VENUE REALLY READY?

As spring turns into summer, it seems like every day there are new

pieces of good news arriving. With more areas of the country seeing
the pandemic in recession, more and more cities and states are

giving venues permission to hold full-attendance events. For those of us in
the events business as well as those who drive our business -- the fans --
it’s a welcome shift. But the pandemic? Hate to say so, but it ain’t over yet.

As mask requirements in the U.S.
start to fall by the wayside and
vaccinated people are beginning to
return to “normal” lives, it’s tempting
to just say “it’s over.” But that’s not
really true. Just look to Japan, where
the Olympics will be held later this
summer with no outside visitors and
strict limits on attendance at every
event, all to keep the Covid-19 virus
at bay. Or look to other parts of the
world where infections linger on. New
variants of the virus are starting to
cause small increases in infections
here in the U.S., mainly in places

where vaccination levels are low.

So yes, if your region says it’s safe, go
ahead and hold your events. But it’s
still a good time to ask your school,
team or venue -- are there ways to
use technology to help keep fans
protected as they come back? If fans
are returning, is your venue really
ready to make them feel safe and
welcome?

FOCUS ON THE ENTRY

In our previous coverage of what
venues were doing to help keep fans
safe as events started to happen

again, the simplest thing venues
could do was eliminate lines. Today,
most people understand the idea of
social distancing in public situations.
If venues can eliminate lines or make
them shorter and faster it’s an easier
task for all involved.

The first place to try to whittle down
lines is the most obvious, entry into
the stadium or arena. While every
venue we’ve talked to has made the
shift to requiring digital tickets for
entry, the question remains -- are
venues ready technologically to
handle the shift to digital ducats?

the back-end processing side.

It’s encouraging to see more venues
experiment with new technologies.
TD Garden opened a couple of walk-
out stores earlier this year (where
cameras and sensors record what
fans are buying) using technology
from Amazon. Zippin technology
powered a new store at AT&T Center
in San Antonio. And Mashgin will
have its checkout technology will in
place at the PGA Tour’s Travelers Golf
Championship in late June. Mashgin
camera scanners look at what a fan
is buying and then post the cost on a
nearby card-payment machine.

STADIUM
TECH REPORT

What that means on the most
basic level is, does your venue have
adequate connectivity just outside
the doors -- the very place where
many fans realize they need to
download their tickets? In our lead
profile this issue the IT team at the
Colorado Rockies told us about a big
paradigm shift from several years
ago. They purposely cut off Wi-Fi
access just outside the stadium
gates (mainly to keep it separate from
the nearby residential buildings). In
the Rockies’ offseason deployment
of Wi-Fi 6 the team went the other
direction, adding significant coverage
around the stadium’s exterior,
especially outside the entry gates
and even extending into the new
McGregor Square area adjacent to the
ball park.

At FC Cincinnati’s new TQL Stadium
(profiled in our previous issue) the
same thinking was in place: Third-
party DAS operator Mobilitie designed
in extra coverage for spaces outside
the main entry, with the historical
knowledge that many fans don’t
think about downloading a digital
ticket until they are within sight of the
stadium.

A second step some venues have
taken is to upgrade the next choke
point in fan-entry flow -- metal
detectors. We’ve not been out to
see new detector systems live, but
reports from our field scouts tell
us that the walk-through detectors
at Wrigley Field -- where fans don’t
have to take things out of pockets or

purses -- are light-years better than
the systems they replaced. Similar
systems installed at Miami’s Hard
Rock Stadium got thumbs-up from
fans. Is your venue moving in this
direction or will your detector line still
resemble an airport?

CONCESSIONS: LESS CASH, MORE
AUTOMATION

We’ve also profiled how concessions
technology can help venues keep fans
safe by reducing person-to-person
contact. By adding more automation
to the ordering and fulfillment of drink
and food, lines are shrinking.

Major League Baseball took things
a step further than most leagues
by requiring that all concessions
purchases be made through the
league-standard Ballpark app. But
judging by some early problems with
the process, more fan education and
maybe some in-person help might
have been warranted. Many venues
reported issues like orders not going
through or fans not completely
understanding the process at the
early games this season. It might be
low-tech, but increased signage with
online ordering instructions and even
some “ambassador” type staffers
might not be a bad idea to help fans
new to the process.

As a team or venue it’s also good to
ask if the wireless coverage in and
around your concessions areas is at
full strength, making sure that the
increase in wireless traffic can be
handled both on the client side and on

COORS FIELD GETS
WI-FI 6 UPGRADE
AHEAD OF ALL-STAR GAME

\ \  BY PAUL KAPUSTKA

Even with a full house of fans expected in

July, one thing that didn’t cause any last-
minute chaos was the upgrading of the

stadium’s Wi-Fi network, which had already been
undergoing a full renovation with added capacity
and support for the new Wi-Fi 6 standard. With
finishing touches being put in place at the time of
a Stadium Tech Report visit to Coors Field in early
May, the new Wi-Fi network should be able to more
than handle the connectivity needs of the expected
50,000-plus guests at one of the first 100-percent
capacity “big events” since the Covid-19 pandemic
hit last year.

When Major League Baseball moved this year’s All-Star
Game from Atlanta to Denver, it no doubt set off a lot of
organizational scrambling in order to get Coors Field ready
to host the sport’s mid-summer celebration.

MAKING A GOOD NETWORK BETTER

Unlike the need driving some upgrades or
network refreshes, the Wi-Fi situation at Coors
Field wasn’t exactly underperforming. Four years
ago, a visit by Stadium Tech Report found that
the network that was initially deployed for the
start of the 2015 season was doing fine, with
strong performance marks all around the “old”
venue, which opened in 1995.

Coors Field was one of the first stadiums that
took part in the first iteration of Major League
Baseball’s 2014-era “tech consortium” -- where
the league partnered with teams, equipment
vendors and wireless service providers to bring
negotiated-cost Wi-Fi and DAS deployments to
every stadium that didn’t have them, a plan that
eventually touched 23 of the MLB parks.

But even if the early networks were still working,
with a new Wi-Fi standard available, it seemed
like a good time to upgrade the old systems
since for just about every public Wi-Fi or cellular
network, demands continue to only go up with
each passing year. For 2020, MLB had hatched a
new consortium-type plan to bring the new Wi-Fi
6 standard to stadiums before the start of the
season, and Coors Field was slated to be one of
the first to get an upgrade.

STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   SUMMER 2021     9

Then, the Covid-19 pandemic hit and with fans not
coming to stadiums, deployment plans were delayed.

Fast-forward to 2021, and another curve ball arrived,
in the form of a February deal struck between MLB
and Extreme Networks under which Extreme would
become the league’s “official Wi-Fi solutions provider,”
with 16 teams signing on to get Extreme gear installed.
Coors Field, however, had a slight issue in that it
had already purchased Wi-Fi 6 gear for its planned
upgrade, from previous consortium supplier Cisco.

While the Colorado Rockies remain committed to
the MLB consortium plan, with the league’s blessing
the team moved ahead with its already-underway
deployment of Cisco gear, with design and installation
done by AmpThink. The new network at Coors Field
also includes some Extreme Networks Wi-Fi 6
gear, located in bullpens and dugouts as part of an
extension to the MLB/Extreme Wi-Fi deal.

ADDING CAPACITY, FINE-TUNING PLACEMENTS

Even if the existing Wi-Fi network was working well,
the Rockies knew it was time to increase the capacity
and reach of the system, especially in the area just
outside the stadium walls.

“In the past, we really didn’t want a Wi-Fi signal outside
the stadium, and we even configured it so that there

was a ‘waterfall’ dropoff once you got a few steps
away,” said Mike Bush, senior director of information
systems for the Rockies. “But now, we want fans to
have access outside.”

To that end, the deployment team of the Rockies, MLB,
Cisco and AmpThink added a number of new antenna
placements all around the signature red-brick outside
facade, and significantly increased the Wi-Fi coverage

every day.

Extra Wi-Fi coverage was installed for exterior gathering places, like stadium
entry gates

at the newly refurbished entry gates where the Rockies
built awning coverages for the security lanes -- which
became a perfect mounting place for overhead Wi-Fi
antennas.

The team also extended network coverage down the
walkway outside Gate E on the stadium’s south side,
to the new McGregor Square area where fans are
expected to gather before, during and after events.
During our visit our Wi-Fi connection switched
automatically from the Verizon-customer SSID to
a Rockies-specific SSID when we walked from the
stadium to McGregor Square. Inside the outdoor plaza
area, where a huge curved LED screen was showing
live game action, we got a speedtest of 44.6 Mbps on
the download and 62.1 Mbps on the upload.

down in many areas, installing
two antennas where there
used to be just one.

Other capacity-increasing
tweaks included moving

spots closer to the end,

seamless, where you just
jump on the network once
and stay connected,”
Bush said. Bush added
that the network now also
reaches out to the Coors
Field parking lots, with
some spaces a half-mile
away from the stadium.

Like just about all other
sports events these days,
MLB games are now using
all-digital ticketing, which
makes the increased
coverage at entry gates
especially important.
Bush noted that in the
past, fans in groups were
able to enter with all
tickets being scanned off one device, but now safety
and security procedures requires that every fan has a
single digital ticket -- which means more devices need
to connect to a network for entry.

As fans were entering the stadium we stopped by the
main gate inside lobby, where a few new AP placements
no doubt helped with the speedtest we got, with 108
Mbps for download and 91 Mbps for upload.

DOUBLING DOWN ON THE LOWER BOWL

When the original Wi-Fi network was installed at
Coors Field, new design techniques like railing antenna
enclosures and under-seat locations were not yet
mature, so the Rockies went with the more traditional
overhead and back-to-front
or front-to-back deployment
methods to cover most of the
seating area.

For the upgrade the ballpark
architects wanted to stick to
that method, which meant that
the Rockies, AmpThink and Cisco had to get creative in
expanding the number of APs and antennas. One feature
that was utilized frequently was the fact that the newer
Cisco APs can support two 5 GHz antennas per unit, which

project manager, who is responsible for overseeing the
Coors Field upgrades. In all, Coors Field increased its
antenna count from 570 to 805, using 720 APs, with 85
of those being the dual-antenna version. Previously the
stadium had 570 APs.

AmpThink also installed newer versions of the so-
called “coffin” box enclosures for locations like the ones
on the field wall pointing back up into the stands, which
are thinner and easier to maintain with easier access
and more easily replaceable electronics.

“The new installations reflect years and years of us
perfecting our enclosures,” said AmpThink’s Miller,
who noted that while in the past AmpThink bought the
enclosure hardware it now designs and manufactures
its own patented offerings, which
are specifically built to withstand
things like stadium power-
washing.

The upgrade plan also sought to
solve some previous connectivity
problem areas, like several sections of ADA seating on
the upper deck that weren’t easily covered by antennas
from below or above. The solution this time was found
in a bit of unused space behind the restrooms on the
upper-level concourse. By putting AP electronics

inside the space and then drilling a hole through the
concrete wall to put antennas outside, the team was
able to deploy flat-panel antennas right behind the ADA
seating, which should more than solve any previous
issues.

Expanded capacity also took place on the network’s
back end, where 55 new Cisco 9300 edge switches
were deployed along with new Cisco 9500 series core
routers, to help enable a backbone bandwidth upgrade
from 1 Gbps to 10 Gbps.

MORE CONNECTIVITY FOR THE ROOFTOP, FOR WHEN
FANS COME BACK

At the time of our visit, local regulations would only

capacity of the 50,000-seat park, but that limit was
recently raised. Coors Field is now allowed to have
full capacity seating, which means there should be a
completely sold-out stadium for the All-Star Game and
all its surrounding festivities, including the popular
Home Run Derby. If the Covid-19 infection rates keep
dropping in the current trend, the team is hoping that it
will be able to have no limitations on attendance when
the All-Star Game festivities arrive in mid-July.

Bush, for one, is looking forward to the re-opening of
the stadium’s popular “Rooftop” area, a segment of the
upper right-field deck where seats were removed and

stroll-around areas were built around a food and bar
complex. According to Bush, more Wi-Fi capacity was
added in the Rooftop area as well, since statistically it
has proven to have the highest data use rates of any
section of the stadium.

more and more important to the fan experience,” Bush
said. “We want to have the capacity needed to support
all that, to allow people to have a great experience and
then be able to share it instantly.”

And those data rates should only go up, as fans return
and find not just more raw capacity but also the
potential increases in speed and efficiency promised
by the Wi-Fi 6 standard, which is now included in most
popular devices, including Apple’s iPhone 11 and iPhone
12 series.

While projections of Super Bowl-sized crowds
assembling to watch live gaming events haven’t
quite materialized yet, the undeniable popularity of
competitive gaming, from casual play, to collegiate
events, to pro leagues, has many organizations
scrambling to figure out the best way to build
special-purpose facilities to support all the needs of
competitive gaming; from instruction and training to
actual events.

Like almost all other competitive sports, esports
worldwide were affected by the Covid-19 pandemic,
which put a halt to almost all live-attendance events
for most of the past year. But as things start to return
to normal, many supporters -- especially U.S. colleges
-- are looking for ways to build facilities that can not
only host live events, but act as training or casual-play

facilities that can realize some revenue from paid-play
time or corporate sponsorships.

For the University of Arizona, a company called 1337
Facilities -- we’ll explain the name in a bit -- led by
longtime sports technology deployment expert Bob
Jordan, has developed a model for building a flexible
esports facilities using existing university space. By
using uniquely designed furniture manufactured by
AmpThink that can quickly transition from tournament
setting, to team training, to class-type instruction,
the company was able to reconfigure an existing

backers and promoters seeking venues of their own.
The ambition is right-sized facilities that maximize
performance and enjoyment of the action.

On the high end of the expectation curve are special-
purpose esports venues like esports Stadium

campus billiards room into an esports facility for about
a quarter-million dollars.

According to Jordan, a flexible system that can
accommodate the widest ranges of gaming needs is a
much better solution -- economically and operationally
-- than single-purpose venues
that have inherent constraints on
flexibility.

“There has to be a way to create
gaming centers that meet all of
the needs of esports including
revenue generation,” said Jordan.
“I think our approach to modularity
sets us apart.”

WHAT IS THE APPETITE FOR LIVE ESPORTS EVENTS?

Big gaming events, like yearly championship matches
for the top pro teams playing the most popular games,
have been held in existing basketball-sized arenas.
But the specialized needs for professional-level
gaming -- including high-speed network connectivity
and integrated digital displays for sharing the action
with the fans in attendance -- have many esports

But the unanswered question remains the appetite for

and Gary Briggs. Jordan Rambis is the son of former
NBA player Kurt Rambis and a minority owner of Evil
Geniuses, a well-known professional gaming team.
Gary Briggs is CEO of Real Time Strategies, which
organizes and produces gaming events.

Together, the trio formed 1337 Facilities. In gaming
lingo, “1337” is numeric shorthand for “Leet” (if you
look at the numbers upside-down) meaning “elite.”
Rambis and Briggs combined their esports knowledge
with Jordan’s facilities expertise in order to pursue
the collegiate esports market with the goal of helping
schools design, build and operate esports facilities
that could address a wide range of uses and potential
revenue streams.

NOT JUST FOR EVENTS, BUT FOR PRACTICE AND FUN

At some big-name schools that were early adopters of
an esports strategy, the facilities are designed to see
how many players could be packed into a space.

“We saw some deployments with lots of desks and
infrastructure,” Jordan said. “Modularity had never
been considered. Our look at this market was to be
smaller and adaptable, at a lower price point to make
dynamic use of space. Our model was one of a greater
audience and more uses than a static deployment.”

To help flesh out the idea, 1337 Facilities brought on
stadium technology master integrator AmpThink as
an investing partner, bringing a wealth of design and
deployment expertise to the equation.

AmpThink president Bill Anderson, whose firm
custom-manufactures many of the elements used in
its stadium deployments, compared Jordan’s idea to
a traditional arena, which change from basketball to
hockey to concerts to accommodate different events.

“Bob’s idea [for esports] was prescient, because
there are lots of spaces on campuses like pool halls
whose time is past,” Anderson said. AmpThink took the
original 1337 Facilities ideas and solved some issues
with heat management and wiring by designing and
building a package of furniture and infrastructure that
can be easily reconfigured by students. The approach
enables quickly switching from tournament setup, to
team training, to casual play.

The 1337 package includes a “tower” housing the
gaming PCs that with integrated wiring and cooling that
can be easily moved. The tower is coupled with desks

STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   SUMMER 2021     21

to be more than an esports venue and servicing other
events like concerts to make the financials work.
One thing that may be hurting the market for live
esports events is the fact that such events are easily
watched online. Huge audiences already showing
their willingness to tap into streams from just about
anywhere, either in live or recorded formats.

At the other end of the playing spectrum, there is
growing demand for public-access casual-play
environments. Venues where gamers of all levels
can use top-end machines and fast connectivity in a
welcoming environment -- the modern equivalent of
the video arcades.

By blending tournament play and casual gaming, 1337
Facilities hopes to tap into a sweet spot in the market --

the American collegiate scene. By repurposing existing
campus spaces into a flexible esports facilities, 1337
builds can host small tournament events, organized
team training, casual play, and even classroom-type
instruction. Their modular approach transitions from
one configuration to another just like an arena may
transition from basketball to hockey to concerts.

HOSTING BIG EVENTS VS. SUPPORTING A WIDER
PROGRAM

Jordan, who has spent several decades in the
sports-venue development and operations space,
said he started looking into esports about four years
ago.”There was a lot of noise, and media attention,”
Jordan said. “I wanted to find out what was really
happening, and where the noise was coming from.”

20    STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   SUMMER 2021

Like he did in his traditional-sports world previously,
Jordan said he started meeting with people involved in
esports. He asked questions like who are the fans, and
what were the opportunities for venue revenues? What
he found was a demographic that was widespread with
lots of growth ahead. He also saw a lot of attention
being diverted to things like how a venue might host a
world championships match.

“The problem with that approach is, there are only so
many championships to go around,” Jordan said.

Jordan also questioned where world-class players
were coming from and what else was happening in
some of the bigger pools of players and enthusiasts --
mainly, the U.S. collegiate scene. Eventually, Jordan’s
search led him to team up with a couple of people who
were active in the esports space – Jordan Rambis

for play that can be folded up or out for different
event configurations.  The company’s first
build even included an AmpThink-designed LED
lighting system to bring some of the visual style
and theming that gamers want in their playing
spaces.

WHO’S COMING TO PLAY

After winning the bid for Arizona’s esports
facility two years ago, the 1337 Facilities plan got
derailed by the pandemic. “Covid put us back 12
months,” Jordan said. “But now all systems are
ready to go, with full operations expected when
students come back to campus this fall.”

Jordan said focus groups conducted by
1337 Facilities showed some non-surprising
desires. For example, gamers wanted “rock-
solid connectivity on high-end PCs, no latency”
in any esports facility. But the focus groups
also showed that students were also looking
for “a place to hang out with other gamers,”
somewhere other than in dorm rooms or with
roommates.

Instead of looking like a classroom or a practice
facility, the Arizona esports facility is more of
“a cool destination for after hours,” Jordan said,
with acoustical panels, video displays, hospitality
and the LED lighting solution that AmpThink

designed from scratch, at a fraction of the cost
of a proposed third-party solution. “For Arizona
students”, Jordan said, “the software being
used to run the up to 65 PCs and six consoles in
the room will allow students to use their meal
cards to rent machines. The operating software
also manages the game inventory, updates and
provides metrics on usage, players and machine
health.”

When it’s time for a tournament-type event,
Jordan said the room can be reconfigured in a very
short amount of time, simply by moving the towers
around, and reconfiguring the desks.

“Within an hour, we can be set up for team play in
a tournament setup with a broadcast area... in the
same space where a day before there might have
been a STEM class taking place,” Jordan said.

“Everyone wants to build the bespoke arena or the
bespoke room,” said AmpThink’s Anderson. “But
what Bob and 1337 have done is make very good
use of an existing space -- and every university has
a space like this.”

“Construction in the
public right of way
is a big deal”

Manufactured by a company called ConcealFab, the
poles were mainly targeted at providing a base for
a range of wireless antennas. Another smart pole
manufacturer is ENE.HUB. Stadium technology
integrator AmpThink has installed one of the ENE.
HUB Smart.Nodes at its Garland,
Texas, headquarters to trial
its capabilities. Owned now
by Brookfield Infrastructure
Partners, ENE.HUB is originally an
Australian company that develops smart poles that are
highly modular and support an impressive volume of
technology.

SEEING WHAT IS POSSIBLE

As part of a partnership with Brookfield, the AmpThink
installation had to address the same requirements
venues and other public places need to satisfy to build
something along a city street.

“Construction in the public right of way is a big deal,”
said AmpThink president Bill Anderson, whose
company unveiled the smart-pole installation earlier
this year. In addition to city construction permits and
other civic negotiations, smart poles
like the Smart.node need connectivity
and power. In this case AmpThink
provided fiber and power from its
adjacent headquarters building.

Right now, modules operative on the AmpThink-hosted
pole include street lighting, a phone charging station,
a car-charging station, convenience outlets, a weather
station, a high-performance microphone, security
cameras, a wireless access point, and a speaker
system.

According to the ENE.HUB product documentation,
the poles can also host a wide range of other systems,
including air quality monitoring sensors, noise
measuring sensors, and ultrasonic detection. The

WILL STADIUMS
EMBRACE SMART
POLES FOR
PARKING LOTS?

\ \  BY PAUL KAPUSTKA

If providing technology inside a stadium is an

accepted idea, bringing more technology to the
spaces just outside stadiums -- mainly parking
lots -- is still a work in progress.

While venues have tried different types of one-off
integrations, like attaching Wi-Fi or cellular antennas
to existing light poles, some new offerings are
coalescing around the idea of a “smart pole.” The
smart pole is a structure designed from the start

The Smart.Node pole, shown here outside AmpThink’s offices, can add features
in a modular fashion. Credit all photos: Dan Grimsley, AmpThink

to be aesthetically pleasing as well as modular and
expandable. Designed as more than a light pole,
smart poles are able to support a wide range of
technologies including wireless connectivity, cameras,
microphones, weather sensors, smart lighting and
even electric-vehicle car-charging ports.

Ahead of this year’s Super Bowl, Verizon helped
fund the deployment of a number of smart-pole
systems outside Raymond James Stadium in Tampa.

Smart.node can be equipped with a range of
lighting and display capabilities. Options include
flood lights, warning/flashing lights, and a digital-
display panel for wayfinding and other information.

CONNECTING FANS

At the Super Bowl deployment, the ConcealFab
poles were a veritable United Nations of wireless
gear. While not every pole hosted every device,
according to ConcealFab, their poles housed:

•  Ultra wide-band Ericsson radios (mmW)

•  CommScope AWS, PCS, and CBRS radios

•  JMA canister antennas

•  Extreme Networks access points and Wi-Fi

antenna

•  Leotek LED luminaires, and

•  Axis cameras

As fans return to venues from the Covid-19
pandemic closures, they will likely find the need for
increased wireless support for digital ticketing and
more-complex wayfinding. Smart poles could be
part of the solution as venues try to allow guests
to connect and be informed well before they are
inside the doors. The poles could also potentially
be a revenue stream, especially with fee-based
services like electric-vehicle charging ports
supported by the ENE.HUB Smart.node.

“At this point, we’re just testing what is possible,”
said AmpThink’s Anderson.
