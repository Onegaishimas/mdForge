Results and Analysis

RESEARCH OVERVIEW

Stadium Tech Report conducted the 2022 Stadium Connectivity Outlook survey in a

partnership with Verizon. The research was conducted to ﬁnd out the "state of the stadium"

marketplace as it pertains to issues around venue connectivity, with a speciﬁc focus on

challenges facing venues as they prepare for a post-pandemic world, including:

• What are their investment priorities in connectivity technology

• What fan experience pain points can connectivity technology help solve

• How will connectivity investments and strategy beneﬁt the business bottom line

• How will venues solve for necessary security measures in a more-connected world

METHODOLOGY

• The survey was conducted online by Stadium Tech Report during August and September,

2022, targeting our reader audience of stadium technology professionals. This includes

professionals working directly for teams, schools and venues, as well as professional

consultants contracted to assist venues in their technology deployments.

• This was a blind data collection process, Verizon was not identiﬁed as the co-sponsor of

the survey.
