LOOKING BACK
AT 10 YEARS OF
COVERING STADIUM
TECHNOLOGY

We’ve come a long way, haven’t we, from
leaky coax to MatSing Lens antennas?
As we start the 10th year of our quarterly
Stadium Tech Report publications, permit
me if you will a short look back to see where
it all started and where we are now.

The good news is, after a decade
of writing about as many stadium
technology deployments as
possible, I don’t have to answer the
question anymore about “why do
you need Wi-Fi in a stadium?” By
now, all those people who asked
that in the past have been to an
event, taken a selfie or a video, and
shared it with someone not there.

So now they get it.

And while we still love a good Wi-Fi
deployment story here at Stadium
Tech Report we’ve expanded our early
repertoire with a question I hope we
get to keep asking: What’s next? And
how will it help improve the game-day
experience for fans while also helping
the venue business operate more
efficiently or profitably?

Answering those two questions
seems to still attract new readers
from our relatively small addressible
audience, which includes at its core
the very people responsible for
making stadiums safe for selfies
-- and all the other things that
require connectivity, a list that keeps
growing without apparent end.

BORN THE SAME YEAR AS LEVI’S
STADIUM

It’s not a coincidence that the first of
our quarterly Stadium Tech Report
issues came out the same year that
the San Francisco 49ers opened
their new home in Santa Clara, Levi’s
Stadium. While you can certainly
debate whether or not the team did
well for its fans by moving to the
South Bay, what’s undeniable is that
the stadium’s focus on technology to
improve the game-day experience
started the era of the connected
venue, helping to improve the
game-day experiences for fans
everywhere.

Yes, other pioneers like their
neighbors to the north at the
baseball stadium now known as
Oracle Park had led the initial charge
toward public connectivity. But
the breadth of the Levi’s Stadium
vision -- including the revolutionary
commitment to under-seat antennas
for Wi-Fi -- put a stake in the ground
that caused others to follow. While
some of the elements of the Levi’s
Stadium opening-day vision did not

exactly survive -- like the promise of
mobile-ordered concessions delivery
to every seat in the stadium -- the
overall idea behind Levi’s Stadium,
that technology could and should be
used to help fans enjoy themselves
better, was correct.

Along the way, venues old and new
took the Levi’s Stadium idea and ran
with it, first with finding ways to make
connectivity better for fans, and then
finding ways to use it themselves
to provide even more amenities.
Innovation came from companies
both large and small around the
stadium-technology edges, as people
tried different ways to use technology
to do things like make it easier to
park, check a ticket, and buy a hot
dog and a beer.

Like Levi’s Stadium, not all of the
ideas survived and some (like mobile
ordering) are still in a state of flux
and experimentation; but also like
Levi’s Stadium the overall mission
in the world of stadium technology
deployment is clear: Yes, you should
not only have Wi-Fi in stadiums
but you should also have as much
technology as possible to eliminate
the kinds of problems that happen
at scale, like long lines to get into
a stadium, or half-hour waits at a
concession stand.

FORCED BY THE HAND OF COVID

For several years, in any sport there
were venues that were technology
laggards and slow followers, and
budget-conscious stadium operators

who couldn’t see the value of
investing a lot of money in technology
for a place that was only open six or
seven days a year. The “don’t fix what
isn’t broken” argument worked for
some who didn’t want a lot of change.

And then Covid-19 arrived, and when
fans were allowed back in stadiums a
lot of those old ways of doing things
wouldn’t work anymore.

In the small time since stadium
shutdowns ended, the pace of
stadium technology acceptance
and deployment has accelerated
immensely, for both social and
business reasons. Digital ticketing,
which had not yet been fully adopted,
became the only way to get into
the arena, overnight. Cashless
concessions, another technology
wish-list item that was seeing some
experimentation pre-pandemic, also
quickly became the only way to do
things.

The need to eliminate lines speeded
up the development and deployment
of walk-through security scanners
and checkout-free concession
stands. As we all hope and pray that
we don’t see another worldwide
pandemic ever again, one thing we’re
not giving back in its aftermath is the
new attitude and faster adoption of
more and more technology to help
make stadiums safer, more fun, and
easier and cheaper to operate. Fans
have seen it, and like the changes. It’s
here to stay.

WHAT’S NEXT?

When we started doing this thing 10
years ago I had no idea that by now
our publication would be writing
about network-connected toilets
or facial recognition systems that
allow fans to buy a beer by smiling
at a screen. Back then, just having
enough bandwidth to send someone
a photo from the arena was a victory.

But I wouldn’t have written off
the idea, either. One of the most
interesting things about stadium
technology is that stadiums almost
always have to bend and twist
existing technology to make it work
under the non-standard operating
conditions known as “game day,”
which is like holding a Super Bowl
party but inviting 75,000 of your
closest friends. Good luck keeping
the cooler filled.

Getting the answer about how
stadiums do that was interesting
10 years ago, and it’s even more
interesting now. Thanks for reading,
and thank you to our sponsors whose
support allows us to go along for the
ride, meet lots of great people, and
tell their stories. May it keep being as
fun as it’s been so far.

Mirroring a rising trend of consumer-directed and automated experiences
in many other areas of commerce, such as checkout-free stores, self-
serve beverage technology has now reached several dozen major stadiums
and arenas in North America, allowing fans to purchase both alcoholic and
non-alcoholic drinks themselves, often in a matter of mere seconds.

T he decades-old stadium and arena refrain of “beer, here!” from

exuberant hawkers, a sound almost as ingrained with the in-
person sports experience as the roar of the crowd itself, is
increasingly being joined by a transformative wave of self-serve

beverage technology.

That technology has arrived in numerous individual forms,
ranging from high-end vending machines focused on
canned beer to virtual bartenders capable of producing a
wide variety of mixed drinks and cocktails.

But in each instance, the core goals from deploying
that technology are essentially the same: reducing wait
times that remain a key pain point in the overall fan
experience, curbing product waste and spillage, and
generating additional revenue for stadium operators
and partner concessionaires.

MORE OPTIONS MEANS MORE SALES

“There’s clearly been a shift toward automated,
unmanned solutions for food and beverage, and we’re
part of that wave,” said Corey Yantha, founder and chief
executive of Dispension Inc. Dispension, a Canadian
company that last year introduced its SmartServ
beverage technology at Dodger Stadium, home of Major
League Baseball’s Los Angeles Dodgers for the league’s
2022 All-Star Game, is now finalizing installation deals
with two other pro venues.

SmartServ has focused on self-serve beer in large-
format cans typically around 24 ounces.

“Conversion rates are really
important to these venues.
And by increasing points of
sale, and reducing congestion
and lines in the concourse,
people are going to spend
more,” Yantha said.

Given the confined spaces at many stadiums and
arenas and the need to maintain fan flow for safety
reasons, simply increasing beverage points-of-sale in
a traditional, manned sense is frequently not possible.
But the automated self-serve beverage technology,
typically taking on the form of a large vending machine
or a portable van-sized cart, is often placed along
otherwise blank concourse walls and in previously
unused corners of venues.

“The mobile self-serve space is definitely something
where we’re seeing particular growth,” said Ben
Maphis, vice president of technology for Sestra
Systems, a Virginia-based company working with a
dozen venues, including Gillette Stadium, home of the
National Football League’s New England Patriots, and
Levi’s Stadium, home of the NFL’s San Francisco 49ers.

COVID-19 AS AN ACCELERANT

While the roots of self-serve beverage technology
go back in earnest at least a decade, and perhaps
beyond that to traditional vending machines, it was the
Covid-19 pandemic that really helped catapult these
offerings to the forefront.

With most venues unable to host fans for at least a year
during the worst of the public health crisis, vendors of
all stripes that serve those buildings were left with vast
amounts of extra time for research and development.
And when attending fans began to return in full in 2021,
many concessionaires found that restaffing to full, pre-
pandemic levels a marked challenge.

sectors from a sports industry still tradition-bound in
many ways.

And despite existing challenges in serving fans in
a timely fashion, providers of self-serve beverage
technology often find their biggest competitor isn’t
another vendor, particularly as many of the key
competitors have staked out their own specific lanes
within this burgeoning space.

Rather, the primary competition is often a regular
bartender or manned concession stand.

“The biggest thing we’re
competing against is the
status quo, both at the back
end, and with consumers,”
Honeysuckle continues.
“Changing processes is
initially difficult, and there’s a
bit of an initial learning curve
compared to throwing ice in
a trough and putting bottles
out on a counter.”

As that product differentiation between different self-
serve technologies continues to codify, the willingness
among various technology providers to service and

“There were a lot of people sitting around [during the
pandemic], and we looked to use that time [to develop
its systems],” said Justin Honeysuckle, chief executive
of TendedBar, a Florida-based provider of automated
systems that produce custom-made cocktails.

TendedBar is now in nearly a dozen major venues,
including Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte,
North Carolina; TIAA Bank Stadium in Jacksonville,
Florida; Empower Field at Mile High in Denver; Allegiant
Stadium in Las Vegas; and Circuit of the Americas
in Austin, Texas, with several other new accounts in
active development.

Adds Dispension’s Yantha, “We knew there was a big
opportunity to distribute canned beverage in stadiums,
where there was a lot of challenges with congestion,
long lines, and staffing issues, which grew over the
course of the pandemic.”

But as matchmaking between vendors, teams, venue
operators, and concessionaires increased during the
pandemic, those vendors still found resistance in many

sell different type of beverages has also increasingly
varied. Some vendors and systems openly embrace
all types of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, while
others have found that soda and water don’t have
a sufficient profit margin for the revenue-sharing
agreements many of the self-serve companies have
with concessionaires and venue operators.

“We’re there to help the clients make the most money
possible,” Honeysuckle said. “Selling a 42-ounce soda
for six bucks isn’t the market we’re trying to have
compared to selling $20 liquor drinks.”

DIFFERING AUTHENTICATION TECHNOLOGIES

With any self-serve beverage technology providing
alcohol, the foremost question is how to deliver that
product, but maintain age verification and comply with
local laws.

But there are additional operational and legal concerns

“In the alcohol world, it’s not just, ‘are you 21?’ It’s also,
‘are you not drunk?’,” said Jose Hevia, chief executive
of DraftServ, a Georgia-based company that made an
initial splash with its automated beverage system at
Major League Baseball’s 2014 All-Star Game, and has
since moved into an Internet-of-Things (IOT) model
of helping teams and concessionaires automate and
connect existing beverage systems.

Yantha and Dispension, which initially built its
corporate base by developing kiosks to safely
distribute a variety of regulated products, are now
developing a patented solution called Intoxivision that
uses thermal imaging to determine in a contactless
fashion whether or not a consumer is intoxicated.
The company is looking to introduce that emerging
technology by the end of 2023.

But in the short term, many self-serve
beverage systems still require some
manned support and monitoring, not unlike
how self-scanning lanes at a grocery store
that have on-floor management present to
help shoppers.

“There’s still an oversight component to
self-serve alcohol systems that won’t
be fully automated in the near future,
particularly from a liability standpoint for
venue operators,” Hevia said.

PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS OVER OLD
METHODS

Not surprisingly, the self-serve beverage
systems often offer a sizable difference
in performance improvements compared
to traditional methods. TendedBar, for

Initial age-verification systems in this area relied
in on RFID-based technology, wristbands, and pre-
registration. More recent applications, however,
have largely shifted to age-gating based on facial
recognition, typically deployed in combination with
user driver licenses or other identification that
matches photos on those IDs with real-time facial
scanning as that user approaches the beverage
machine.

example, claims a throughput rate of 35 people per five
minutes at a single, four-screen bar. Such a delivery
rate, combined with the level of drink customization
that the system provides, would be hard to match in a
normal, manned setting.

“That number stands by itself in a high-volume
environment,” Honeysuckle said. “And we’re making a
fresh drink every time.”

SUSTAINABLE FUTURE

CommScope is committed to advancing networks with

a vision for producing innovative technology that can

play a vital role in creating a sustainable future.

At many venues, though, the self-serve technology is
not simply about improving speed of service or overall
revenue, or necessarily those factors at all, but also
about offering a differentiated level of fan experience.
Other systems such as DraftServ place a high priority
on curbing spillage and waste and maximizing product
yields from beer kegs and other beverage dispensers.

“It really depends on what you’re trying to solve for,”
which can vary widely by team or venue, said Alicia
Woznicki, vice president of design and development
for Aramark Sports and Entertainment, a major
concessionaire which works with hundreds of pro and
collegiate teams and has actively explored self-serve
beverage technology for the better part of a decade.
“Are you trying to offer a cool, experiential amenity, or
are you trying to get back people back to their seat and
happy they have their beverage?”

To that end, Woznicki says Aramark’s efforts to date in
the self-serve beverage space have often seen better
performance metrics from efforts that more closely
mirror retail and commerce applications outside of

sports venues, such as selling bottled products with
checkout-free technology.

“In Asia, anything comes from a vending machine, and
people are willing to adopt that,” Woznicki said. “But
[in North America], we haven’t seen the same kind of
adoption on the vending [-based technologies] yet that
we would have hoped for. So we have to figure what is
the right way to set up the solutions, and make sure
they don’t get lost on the concourse.”

Ultimately, self-serve beverage technologies in sports
will also borrow heavily from other areas of hospitality
and entertainment such as hotels, theme parks, movie
theaters, chain restaurants, and airports – all high-
volume areas that are key targets for many of the
primary vendors in this space.

“The addressable market is so much larger than just
sports venues,” Honeysuckle said.

T he Wi-Fi network data usage

at this year’s Super Bowl LVII
just barely set a new high-water
mark for the big game, with 31.5
terabytes used just topping last year’s total
of 31.2 TB, according to statistics released by
Extreme Networks.

And while the event did see a new record in
the per-fan usage of data at 643 megabtyes
per device, its Wi-Fi mark fell short of
setting an overall top Wi-Fi day record due
to the 34.8 TB number seen at an Ohio State
game this past fall.

All of the statistics are from the game, a
thrilling 38-35 victory for the Kansas City
Chiefs over the Philadelphia Eagles on Feb.
12, 2023, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale,
Ariz. Some of the numbers we did get are
worth diving into, especially the very small
overall jump in Wi-Fi usage, which can
possibly be explained due to several factors.

FEWER FANS, BUT MORE DATA PER CONNECTED
DEVICE

While historically over the recent past we have been
treated to big jumps each year in overall Wi-Fi data
usage at each Super Bowl, the smaller attendance
at this year’s Super Bowl of 67,827 fans (compared to
70,048 at last year’s game) was just one factor that
likely contributed to the “smaller” overall growth.
The Ohio State game that set the new top mark, for
example, had 106,787 in attendance.

However, the number we’ve been paying more attention to
at the past few non-Covid events -- the average data used
per connected device -- did show a big jump this year at
the Super Bowl, with the 643 MB per device setting a new
high mark, besting the 595.6 MB per device set at Super
Bowl LIV in Miami in 2020.

Another interesting number to note from this year was
the 10 percent drop in “take rate,” or the number of
fans on the Wi-Fi network out of the total number of
fans present. This year’s numbers of 48,923 connected
devices out of 67,827 total attendance showed only a 72
percent Wi-Fi take rate, down from a high of 82 percent
at Super Bowl LVI last year at SoFi Stadium when
57,628 devices connected to the network out of 70,048
total attendance.

Possible explanations for the lower take rate include
the lower number of Wi-Fi APs installed at the two
stadiums (approximately 1,500 at State Farm Stadium
compared to 2,521 at SoFi Stadium), as well as the
expanded 5G cellular connectivity installed at State
Farm Stadium ahead of the Super Bowl, which did lead
to record-breaking jumps in the cellular data used at

18    STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   SPRING 2023

STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   SPRING 2023     19

the big game. We are still working with the top cellular
carriers to see if there had been a significant jump this
year in 5G-only traffic, so stay tuned.

But the jump in per-device usage is an interesting
one, maybe perhaps due to the increase of consumer
devices that support the Wi-Fi 6 standard? According
to stats from Ohio State and others, pure Wi-Fi 6 traffic
has been increasing lately, which may mean that the
touted attributes of the Wi-Fi 6 standard are finally
flexing! We have asked Extreme to see if they can
provide Wi-Fi 6 specific numbers, so stay tuned.

As we detailed in our Super Bowl wireless preview, the
new Wi-Fi 6 network at State Farm Stadium uses gear
from Cisco, including the new Cisco 9104 antennas
which provide farther-reach coverage that allows for
placements on structures farther away from the fans. So
why do we quote Extreme Networks for statistics? That’s
because official Super Bowl Wi-Fi usage numbers are
supplied by Extreme under Extreme’s deal with the NFL
as its Official Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi analytics provider.

PREGAME, HALFTIME CAUSE PREDICTABLE SPIKES IN
TRAFFIC

According to Extreme the network also saw a record
peak throughput rate of 25.8 Gbps, topping last year’s
record mark of 20.7 Gbps. The Extreme release did
note that “The peak spike in bandwidth occurred when
teams were announced and entered the field,” with
193.5 GB recorded at that time. The Extreme release
also said that the halftime show featuring Rihanna and
singers on the amazing airborne stages “drove a 450%+
increase in bandwidth usage” on the Wi-Fi network.

Extreme also broke out data into an infographic showing
the top apps used in several categories. In sports apps,
ESPN was first, followed by the NFL, while Facebook lead
the social-media parade followed by Instagram, Twitter,
Snapchat and Reddit in descending order. Apple, YouTube
and Disney were the top three streaming apps, followed
by Ring, an interesting addition as maybe fans at the game
were checking their front doors remotely? Netflix came in
fifth in streaming apps, which in the past Extreme execs
had said could be due to fan groups with small children,
who may prefer their favorite shows to the football game.

and fans with wireless

VERIZON, AT&T BREAK RECORDS FOR BIG-GAME
CELLULAR DATA USE

One the cellular side, any doubt that wireless data
usage at big events is continuing to grow was put to
rest, when Verizon and AT&T reported at combined
68.8 terabytes of data use in and around State Farm
Stadium during Super Bowl LVII — about 58 percent
more than the total seen last year.

Both Verizon’s reported mark of 47.8 TB and AT&T’s
total of 21 TB set single-day records for each of the
cellular carriers. Last year at Super Bowl LVI at SoFi
Stadium, Verizon reported 30.4 TB of data and AT&T
saw 13 TB of data for a total of 43.4 TB to set the
previous high-water marks.

We will attempt to find out more granularity around the
data, but our guess is that the 5G network investments
made by the carriers may have been partially behind
the big jump, or at least a factor in the traditional
annual data-demand growth that shows no sign of
stopping. According to Verizon, 60 percent of the
cellular users at Sunday’s big game were Verizon
customers. T-Mobile did not report any statistics from
the game.

is well underway. This Stadium Tech Report Market
Report will focus on check-out-free stores. Who are
the providers, how do they work, how do they benefit
venues and guests, and what challenges they pose for
the concessionaires.

WHY CHECKOUT-FREE: FASTER SERVICE, MORE
REVENUE

For years, fans have accepted long lines, slow
service, and inaccurate menus as part of the stadium
concessions experience. Empowered by consumer
behavior changes post-Covid, stadiums are deploying
multiple technologies to speed up and improve the
process. While there were experiments before the
pandemic, preferences for social distancing, fewer

lines and less human interaction have ignited an
explosion of new concession technology.

Any fan who has been to sporting events in the past
can easily grasp the benefits of a checkout-free
concession stand. Instead of having to wait in a long
line, missing critical chunks of the event they paid to
attend, they can obtain food and drinks in seconds
rather than minutes.

While the fan’s first engagement with such a store can
be confusing, the learning curve is rapid, with many
fans finding they can visit a concession multiple times
simply because they’re back in their seats so quickly.
The technology adds an element of surprise and fun
to something that is is otherwise an everyday activity,
prompting some fans to stop and take photos or videos
of their checkout-free experiences.

For venues, the checkout-free stand is a godsend
in an era where it’s increasingly hard to find enough
people to fully staff a stadium for game days. Instead
of needing a full team of order takers and food runners
to process orders, checkout-free stands can operate
with as few as one or two outside staff offering
instructions to newcomers and to checking IDs for
alcohol purchases.

Not surprisingly, with faster transactions, checkout-
free stands are showing increased per-cap revenues
according to early adopters who have shared
prelimanary statistics.

Aside from the staffing and speed benefits, some
venues are finding opportunities to apply the
technology to previously unused space. By deploying
the slimmer versions of stands that focus on drinks
and prepackaged snacks venues are generating new
revenue. At Barclays Center, where the venue has
deployed several Zippin-powered stands, Zippin execs
claim that stands built under vacant stairwells now
generate as much as $10,000 per stand per event.

HOW DOES IT WORK?

If you’re not familiar with checkout-free stores, here’s
a quick primer. Customers are allowed to enter stores
by scanning a credit card or some other pre-authorized
payment method. After entring the store’s gate they
simply take the items they want off the shelves and then
exitPayment takes place online after they leave the store.

In stadiums, the setup typically involves a secured
area accessed via a set of gates (similar to public-
transportation turnstiles) through which fans enter
and exit. Entry, requires the fan present some method
of identification linked to a payment card -- this can
be a physical credit card; a team/venue app; or with
Amazon you can even use your palm assuming you’ve
pre-register for their Amazon One service. When the
gate turns green you enter, select your items and leave
through the exit gates.

What happens while you are there? A network of overhead
cameras tracks customer activity. Camera data is paired

with an artificial-intelligence engine that visually matches
selected items to a pricing database. Some companies
add shelf sensors to provide additional data and to
improve accuracy. All providers claim their technology
is accurate even if customers pick up an item and put it
back. According to the companies, the cameras do not
use facial recognition or any other type of permanent
identification Instead, they match activity with a
customer “shape” that is linked to the entry transaction.

While these systems promise to greatly reduced staffing
requirements in venues, some live staffing is required.
Staffing is present to help consumers who have not used
the stores before, and to check IDs for alcohol purchases.

WHO ARE THE PLAYERS IN THE MARKET?

In the stadium market, the two leading providers
of checkout-free stores are Zippin with 56 stores,
and Amazon with 40. But the stadium-specific
deployments are just a small slice of the overall market
for checkout-free technology, which has attracted a
strong field of global competitors.

Amazon’s deployment of the technology in some of the
full-size Whole Foods stores is well publicized but other
providers have deployed checkout-free technology
in full-size stores, convenience stores, gas stations,
college campuses, and on airport concourses. Here’s
a quick rundown on the leading providers of checkout-
free technology so far:

AMAZON

As the owner of the Whole Foods grocery chain,
Amazon’s Just Walk Out technology is designed for
more places that just stadium stores. That said, like
some other providers Amazon is probably finding
stadiums to be a good place to test systems since
you don’t have to build out an full-size store to start
getting some results. At last count Amazon had 40
open or announced stadium stores, including four
outlets at each of the large venues close to its Seattle
headquarters -- Climate Pledge Arena, Lumen Field,
and T-Mobile Park. www.aboutamazon.com

ZIPPIN

GRABANGO

A San Mateo, Calif.-based startup, Zippin is the leader
in stadium-specific deployments, with 56 such stores
at our last count. Zippin last raised funding with a
$30 million round in September of 2021, putting its
total venture funding at $45 million. In January Zippin
introduced the Zippin Walk-Up, a design that combines
checkout-free technology with an existing concession
stand, with no physical change needed to the stand.

AIFI

The Santa Clara, Calif.-based AiFi, which is backed in
part by Verizon Ventures, raised $65 million in a series
B round in March 2022 for a total of $80 million raised
so far. Currently AiFi has six known permanent store
deployments, along with some portable stores. AiFi
recently signed a deal to provide checkout-free stores
at the Intuit Dome, which is scheduled to open next year.
www.aifi.com

STANDARD AI

Formerly known as Standard Cognition, this San
Francisco-based firm has been around since 2017,
with more than $230 million of funding raised so far.
In addition to launching its technology at convenience
stores and campus stores, Standard AI is used at two
stadiums -- American Airlines Arena in Dallas, where
there are two Standard AI stores, and at one store at
Polar Park, the home of the minor-league Worcester
(Mass.) Red Sox.  www.standard.ai

TRIGO

The Tel Aviv-based Trigo has partnered with several
large grocery chains in Europe and the U.K. to deploy
its checkout-free technology, including Tesco in the
U.K. and ALDI in the Netherlands. Trigo raised an
additional $100 million in venture capital this past
October, bringing its total venture funding to $204
million. It currently has no known stadium stores using
its technology. www.trigoretail.com

The Berkeley, Calif.-based Grabango has deployed its
checkout-free technology in several convenience store
chains, including Circle K and AM/PM. The company
raised $39 million in a series B funding round in June
2021, putting total funding near $94 million. It currently
has no known stadium stores using its technology.

UPFRONT DEPLOYMENT COSTS A CONCERN FOR
SOME VENUES

While the number of sports-specific checkout-free
stands seems to still be growing rapidly, the technology
is not a slam-dunk for all venues. The biggest
drawback, according to sources at several venues, is
the upfront cost of the stores. Deployments require
special cameras and sensors and can also require
extensive physical renovation of stadium spaces.

For a full-size checkout-free store, offering not just
drinks but hot food selections and merchandise,
physical renovation costs may run $300,000 or more,
according to several sources. In addition to designing
for the entry and exit gates and putting in overhead
cameras and shelf sensors, the stores must have ways
for staff to provide fresh-cooked food or to stock
coolers, preferably from the back so that staff is not
interrupting customer flow.

Some providers, especially Zippin and AiFi, have
responded to the cost concerns by designing smaller
stores, like the “drink lane” design This concept
encapsulates a line of beverage coolers or a short bar
featuring pre-filled drinks, coupled with a shelf or two
for prepackaged snacks.

This January Zippin introduced an even smaller model
of its stand, adding the entry/exit gates to an existing
concession counter, with smaller coolers and food
shelves perched on the existing countertops. AiFi
has a similar model, which incorporates draft beer
or fountain drinks poured behind a counter. AiFi has

28    STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   SPRING 2023

STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   SPRING 2023     29

deployed several of its box-like “popup store” models
at venues including Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, Ford
Field in Detroit, and at the Indy 500.

These systems are sold on a subscription model,
typically requiring a contract that is a year or more
in length. Therefore, venues that only host a small
number of events (e.g. college football stadiums and
race tracks) may find it harder to find the return from
checkout-free technology. The hope for the vendors
is that their smaller-sized options may be priced
reasonably enough for venues to be willing to kick
the tires and see if the benefits are worth the upfront
investment.

REFINING PLACEMENT AND ADDING MORE STORES

While the technology providers in the stadium space
almost all tout their offerings as something that can
“eliminate” concession lines, what we have seen in
the field is that the popularity of these stands can
sometimes create lines outside the gates with fans
lined up for a quick transaction suggesting more stores
may be necessary to handle demand.

At Denver’s Empower Field at Mile High, caterer
Aramark experimented early on with a few Zippin
stores and now has nine checkout-free stands, the
most of any stadium. Since STR began tracking the
technology we have seen several stadiums, including
Lumen Field and T-Mobile Park in Seattle, start
with one stand and then add several more in quick
succession. At the new CityPark soccer stadium in St.
Louis, early fan acceptance of the three Zippin stores
has stadium operators already thinking about adding
more in the future.

Placement strategies for stores are also evolving
as more live-interaction data becomes available. At
Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, the stadium placed two
sets of Zippin drink stands side-by-side, directly across
from traditional belly-up concession stands serving the
upper-bowl seating. According to the venue, the Zippin
stands completely eliminated long lines at belly-up
stands by moving people who only wanted drinks and
maybe a snack out of the lines of people looking for
something more substantial.

The Inside Towers Database, powered by OneVizion, is a platform that
includes 225,000+ tower records, including 40,000+ unregistered sites.

LOOKING AHEAD TO FOOTBALL SEASON

With more expected new deployments to be
announced in the coming months, the real expansion
for checkout-free stores in the stadium space may take
place before the U.S. football seasons arrive in the fall.
What will be interesting from a business standpoint is
to see if the two stadium-focused startups -- Zippin
and AiFi -- will be able to continue compete with the
resources of Amazon. Or, if any of the other players,
like Standard AI, Grabango, or Trigo, will expand into
the U.S. stadium market.

While checkout-free technology may not be a fit for
all types of venue concession operations, it will be
interesting to observe over time how many traditional
belly-up stands are replaced by stands where fans
simply walk through.
