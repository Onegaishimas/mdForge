\ \  FROM THE EDITOR

Paul Kapustka

Welcome to
STADIUM
TECH REPORT!

give the keynote talk at CTIA in Orlando. I had gotten to

It was 2011 and I was listening to AT&T’s John Donovan

Super Bowl (XLV at Cowboys Stadium – now AT&T Stadium)

know John as an analyst covering the 4G wars. During his

address he shared that for the first time ever, at the recent

there was more commercial cellular traffic leaving the venue

than coming in. That one statistic stuck in my mind.

As a former sports writer, I knew that this
signaled a change in the behavior of sports
fans. Cell phones were transitioning from
a distraction to an enhancement of the live
venue experience. Phones enabled fans
to share the game with friends outside the
venue in real time. As a cellular analyst, I
knew that macro cell networks weren’t up
to the task if more people decided to try the
same thing at other venues. Where sports
met technology, the seed of an idea was
formed.

Later that year, I launched Mobile Sports

Report to document the impact of mobile
devices on sports. The general idea was
to first attract an audience, and then
advertisers. Early on, we covered a lot of
interesting and now-dead ideas. But one
topic kept popping up: Wireless network
performance inside of stadiums was bad
and getting worse. Fans were not being
quiet about it, either -- forcing venues to
try to solve the problem. By covering these
stories I was there, a witness to the birth of
high-density (“HD”), large public venue (“LPV”)
networking.

6    STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   WINTER 2021

OUR FOUNDATION: STADIUM
SCALE NETWORKS

By 2014, the debut of Levi’s Stadium
established a performance benchmark.
Levi’s featured an HD under-seat Wi-Fi
network and an extensive DAS. Wireless
networks had been established as a
necessary component of any venue of note
-- and Mobile Sports Report had its calling
card. That same year, we created a quarterly
report to track, analyze, and report on
the progress of this nascent industry. We
offered venues and venue operators insights
into the progress of their peers. We offered
OEMs and integrators a catalogue of their
competitors’ projects. And we recorded the
evolution of an industry.

In addition to documenting individual stadium
and arena implementations, we did surveys
and compiled lists of league and school
wireless deployments. We reported on
network performance and implementation
methods. This was the beginning of an “arms
race.” Our top 10 and then top 25 lists would
become our most read and downloaded
reports. You may hate us or love us for this,
but the industry took notice!

OUR PRIORITY: IN-DEPTH
REPORTING

Focusing on Wi-Fi and DAS deployments, we
built a catalog of knowledge. Our publication
served as a written history of the evolution
of wireless technology in stadiums. Our
ethos, putting objectivity and good stories
first, paid off. We attracted a loyal audience
that represents the vast majority of
professional and collegiate venues in North
America.

In spite of our success, it always felt like
there was something missing, something
important we weren’t getting to. We tried to
replicate our success in wireless networking
by branching out to cover other parts of the
“tech” in stadiums. But, we always found
ourselves constrained by budgets, time,
and the tough task of trying to balance

fan experience, and oh yes -- the newer,
more powerful wired and wireless networks
needed behind it all.

JOIN OUR FUTURE

Like AT&T Stadium -- which used the Covid
downtime this summer to help it build its
massive new distributed antenna network
in just 16 weeks -- we’ve used 2020 to
boldly transform our publication. Already,
we’ve added stories about how things like
cashless stadiums and digital ticketing have
accelerated from test deployments to full
operation. We’ve covered the convergence
of wired networks. We’ve highlighted the
evolution of new stadium construction. And
we’ve highlighted the transformation of fan
behaviors; from hesitant to download an
app to demanding app-based, touchless,
cashless options. What’s next? Let’s find out
together!

A wise person once said, “Make no little
plans.” Following that lead, we are planning
not to cut back but to expand. All are
welcome aboard; advisors, partners,
sponsors, readers, and skeptics. Here’s to
building something better for everyone.

business operations with newsgathering and
storytelling. We’d established a successful
business, but one that always felt like it
needed another gear.

COVID-19 – A CATALYST FOR
CHANGE

For everyone, the Covid-19 pandemic has
been horror beyond contemplation. We
consider ourselves fortunate that we’ve been
able to stay safe and healthy. We extend
our gratitude to those who are doing the
essential work that keeps us all fed, safe, and
alive while we battle the unseen foe. While
the stories have continued to flow, it is only
because of the support of vendors, service
providers, and stadium tech personnel, who
all have relayed information and photos to
share the places we couldn’t visit.

With events canceled, no fans allowed
in most stadiums, and revenue chains
across the entire live-events industry
greatly diminished, we contemplated
scaling back our own operations. But, we
believed that we had an important calling.
For venues to overcome the pandemic it
was going to require more technology, and
more adjustments. To “return to normal,”
our readers would need more, not less,
information.

In March we started a research partnership
with our friends at AmpThink. We conducted
a series of deep-dive, on- and off-the-
record conversations with the best minds
in our industry. We wanted to know what
they thought the business of venues would
look like during and in the aftermath of the
pandemic.

Strangely, we came away from those talks
optimistic. Our initial thinking was correct.
Many of those we talked to mentioned new
technologies and new ideas that would
be needed to confidently bring people
together again. And these ideas ventured
well beyond wireless. Connectivity was part
of the equation, but more an enabler than a
solution.

Now more than ever, the LPV marketplace
needs a voice for these ideas. We envision
Stadium Tech Report as a platform to
profile early adopters and groundbreakers.
A place to share the seeds of the ideas that
will transform venues. We’ve developed
approaches to revamp our coverage
methods, to bring more voices into the fold,
and to use digital publishing to improve our
story-telling capabilities. But with vision
comes expense.

COMMUNITIES ARE BUILT BY
PIONEERS

Stepping in as “co-producer,” a change that
starts with this issue, AmpThink brings a
talented in-house creative team, necessary
cash, and a thick Rolodex of smart people
to the Stadium Tech Report family. The new
Stadium Tech Report’s business model will
build on our cornerstone partner -- AmpThink
-- by attracting a few more top-level partners
to comprise an advisory board who will
contribute their time and resources to our
mission. With the support of these advisors,
we will continue our tradition of providing
relevant and independent news, analysis, and
information. As always, we will not accept
paid-for content or write stories based on
sponsorship deals, but rather tell the best
stories we can.

Internally we call this the “NPR model,”
using the well-known public radio financial
model as our template. In the near term,
our advisors will be our primary source of
financial support. However, we will continue
to offer advertising opportunities for those
who want to continue to reach our audience.
We also plan to open up an online shop to sell
STR-branded schwag for individuals who
want to offer their own support for our vision.

Over time, expect Stadium Tech Report to
evolve. Building on our traditional features,
we will leverage podcasts and video
interviews to offer more in-depth coverage
of the stadium tech world. Future topics
will include compute, concessions, building
automation, security, construction, ticketing,

W hen the building now known as

AT&T Stadium opened in 2009,
it arguably changed the way
the world thought about large
entertainment venues. In many ways it pushed
the envelope on what was possible to make the
fan experience better than imagined, from the
largest-at-the-time videoboard to the stunning,
flexible architecture, which positioned the venue
as a host to events well beyond football.

When cellular giant AT&T added its name to the
venue via sponsorship in 2013, the building was
already well on its way to being one of the leaders
in fan-facing wireless networks, with both a
cellular distributed antenna system (DAS) and
a Wi-Fi network that were both expanded on in
following years.

But sometimes, like a star player whose talents
are fading, networks reach the end of their useful
life, and it’s time for a replacement. Such was the
case with AT&T Stadium’s DAS network the past
few years, as older equipment in an older design
just couldn’t keep up with the growing demands
of a mobile-device-centric fan base.

“Our DAS was really at the end of its life,” said
Matt Messick, chief information officer for
the Dallas Cowboys. The past couple seasons,
Messick said, ”I was receiving instant feedback
about when it was not performing. And last year
was especially rough. At every Cowboys game,
we were hitting the limits.”

“I was receiving instant
feedback about when it

last year was especially

But like a good front office that is constantly seeking to
improve its talent, Messick and the team’s networking
partners had been busy forming a new plan -- one
more than two years in the making -- that threw out

all the old DAS playbooks and instead built something
completely new. The end result included: An incredibly
dense network design, with 670 network zones,
approximately a 10x increase from the previous DAS;
an all-digital infrastructure that allows for more optical
fiber, reducing the amount of telecom gear needed on
premise, resulting in huge power and space savings;
And cutting-edge MatSing Lens antennas to provide
precise coverage to the seating bowl, with the ability to
cover previous problem areas, like lower-bowl seating
and on-field configurations, for concerts and other
events. The DAS will also be able to support lower-band
5G communications when carriers deploy services in
that spectrum.

Taking advantage of the break in event hosting
brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic this summer, the
Cowboys and networking partners ExteNet Systems,

CommScope, MatSing and lead cellular provider AT&T
were able to install the new network in just 16 weeks,
having it ready to go before the Cowboys’ 2020 NFL
season began. And while the limited number of fans
in attendance at home games this year probably had
more bandwidth than they could handle, Messick is
looking forward to a future of full houses, because he’s
confident that the new DAS will be able to support all
the demands the crowds request, for now and into the
foreseeable future.

TAKING A LARGE LEAP INTO THE FUTURE

While any stadium’s operators and network crews may
feel pressure if their wireless isn’t performing well,
consider the extra impetus on making sure mobile
devices work well inside a building that has the name
of one of the nation’s top cellular providers across its
facade.

“The AT&T name on our building is just one of the main
driving factors behind this, and why we needed to take
a large leap into the future,” Messick noted.

Ian Sinclair, AT&T’s director of RAN engineering for
north Texas, agreed.

“For AT&T, this is one place we wanted to be loud and
proud,” Sinclair said.

But if there was agreement on the end goal -- to
build the biggest and best DAS ever -- it was the
devil of the details of how to get there that caused
the most consternation. Jeff Alexander, senior vice
president for ExteNet Systems, the network operator
at AT&T Stadium, said the process started with the
understanding that the new system would be much
more detailed than just a simple upgrade.

With traditional top-down cellular DAS systems under
strain in stadiums everywhere, the partners picking the
new network for AT&T Stadium knew they couldn’t rely
on prior designs to be their guide.

“This had to be nothing like the past -- the past designs
could only get us so far, and we knew we needed
something more, something different,” Alexander said.

“This had to be nothing like the
past — the past designs could
only get us so far, and we knew
we needed something more,
something different.”

In search of a combination of technology and
deployment strategy, the team of partners left no
stone unturned in their search for the pieces needed to
solve the puzzle.

“If I said we looked at every available option, that’s an
understatement,” said Alexander, who ran off a long
list of different vendor equipment and deployment

methods considered, like under-seat, behind-the-seat,
and small-cell architectures, among others.

With stringent requirements for architectural
aesthetics and structural engineering concerns as
well as overall performance, Alexander said that all of
the early ideas failed in one way or
another.

clear line of sight to seats while also keeping them
hidden from fans’ eyes. With its extensive overhead
structure, AT&T Stadium had more than enough places
to mount the MatSing antennas, which were six feet in
diameter, to point down at the seating bowl.

“For some reason, we disqualified
everything we came up with,”
Alexander said.

But then, Alexander said a key
question was asked: “We wondered
-- if we used MatSing antennas,
what would it do for us?”

MATSING ANTENNAS A ‘GAME
CHANGER’

Both AT&T and ExteNet had
some recent experience with the
unique, ball-shaped antennas
from MatSing, which offer multiple
radio antennas with the capability
to allow for incredibly precise
beams of coverage. AT&T, which
installed a DAS based on 52 MatSing
antennas at Amalie Arena in Tampa
a couple years ago, saw good intial
performance from that network at
the NCAA Women’s Final Four in
2019. ExteNet, which used some
MatSing antennas in its DAS design
at the Milwaukee Bucks’ new Fiserv
Forum, said it was pleased with the
performance of the MatSing devices
there.

Since the MatSing antennas can
broadcast a signal much farther
than conventional antennas, the
latest design twist with MatSings
is to put them in the rafters of an
arena, a placing that gives them

With each antenna able to accept 48 remotes,
MatSings give venues a different way to deliver dense
coverage from a single installation spot -- and one
that is much simpler to tune, since the line-of-sight
coverage areas are calibrated with a laser beam
instead of the extensive RF balancing required with
traditional DAS systems. The Las Vegas Raiders
are just one of the recent converts to the school of
MatSing, using 30 antennas to supplement the DAS at
their new home, Allegiant Stadium.

GETTING IN THE ZONE: MORE DAS DENSITY THAN
EVER BEFORE

With the MatSing antennas’ ability to precisely split the
seating area coverage, the team of network partners
had the key element to support their idea that what
was really needed was a radical increase in the “zones,”

or separate areas of antenna coverage, inside the
stadium.

Increasing network density with smaller zones is the
design goal of several new DAS deployment methods,
including under-seat antenna designs, which mimic
the low-power, many-antenna designs familiar to
under-seat Wi-Fi deployments. But with the MatSing
antennas, ExteNet’s Alexander said the network team
was able to support “extremely precise” zones without
having to worry about the costs of drilling under-
seat, or having to do network testing for interference
between nearby devices as would have to be done with
an under-seat design.

“MatSing was just a huge game-changer for us,” the
Cowboys’ Messick said.

STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   WINTER 2021     15

From there, other design elements
and strategic decisions emerged.
One was to make every one of
the stadium’s 380 suites its own
DAS zone. Another was to exclude
the use of lower-band spectrum,
primarily those bands under 1000
MHz, because signals in that
range are actually “too good” at
covering a wide area -- a feature
great for outdoor macro networks
but not so fantastic when you are
trying to deploy low-band cellular
inside a close space. According to
Alexander, the new DAS will only
support licensed cellular spectrum
from 1700 MHz and above.

“Lower bands are just not
controllable,” said Alexander.
Leaving them out, he said, “was a
key to the design.”

DIGITAL DAS BACKBONE
PRODUCES SPACE AND COST
SAVINGS

To support a DAS design with
2,345 remotes, the AT&T Stadium
team turned to longtime partner
CommScope, which had been
the backbone infrastructure and
cabling partner for the original DAS
deployment.

“When we did the first one, the
DAS had 21 zones and we thought
we overbuilt it,” said CommScope
director of business operations
Sean White. Now, there are 238
zones just for the seating bowl.

For the new DAS CommScope

brought its all-digital ERA digital
distributed antenna system, which
uses a Common Public Radio
Interface (CPRI) to link the Era
C-RAN system to Nokia baseband
equipment. According to White,
the system allowed the elimination
of the traditional DAS analog
conversion stage, keeping the
entire system digital. The amount
of power-hungry, bulky telco gear
is substantially reduced, producing
a low power consumption and
huge reduction in head-end room
geographical space. According
to White and AT&T, the carrier’s
internal equipment gear footprint is
about four or five racks, down from
30-40 racks needed in a traditional
DAS deployment.

“When you eliminate the need
for the power and A/C, it’s a
tremendous amount of savings for
operators,” White said.

“It’s an incredible opportunity to
have the DAS be very efficient on
power, space and cooling,” said
AT&T’s Sinclair, whose company is
the first carrier on the new DAS. “It’s
an amazing shift in technology, it’s
very expandable, very neat,” Sinclair
said.

5G AND THE FUTURE: BUILDING A
DAS TO STAND THE TEST OF TIME

On top of the new DAS the stadium
also has an AT&T millimeter wave
5G overlay installation, which
according to Messick is already
producing “ridiculous” speed tests
in the gigabit-per-second range. All

of the capacity is necessary, he said, especially in an
era when teams are already seeing an acceleration of
internal technology-related business plans due to the
concerns raised by the pandemic.

“We had planned a slow roll for things like digital
ticketing, because many people, including suite
holders, still wanted paper tickets,” said Messick of
plans made before Covid-19. But with social distancing
concerns, the Cowboys (like many stadiums that
were open to fans this fall) went immediately to all-
digital ticketing, and also made the leap to cashless
concessions and parking operations.

“We had planned a slow
roll for things like digital
ticketing, because many
people, including suite
holders, still wanted paper
tickets.”

“But to do all that you have to have rock-solid
connectivity,” Messick said. “The timing is right to make
a lot of digital transformations. And now we have the
DAS to support it.”

During our almost hour

long interview – available
as a podcast in the near
future – Chris talked

about getting started with audio/
video technology at his church as
a teenager, a brief stint working as
a systems integrator, and eventual
career as a consultant resulting in
the formation of WJHW in 1990 with
Jack Wrightson, Jim Johnson, and
Bill Haddon.

With 30 years of experience
designing stadium technology,
it was interesting to learn what
keeps Chris going. While he and his
firm may be best known for their
work in sports and entertainment,
WJHW devotes much of their
practice to K-12 AV projects which
offer more volume and a counter
point to the complexities of an NFL
stadium. When pressed to explain
the success Chris has had with
his career, he focused on being
obsessed with the technology being
deployed. That obsession is the key
to being more than a journeyman.

Longevity has provided Chris with
the opportunity to see shifts in
technology in real time. In 2004

A large body of work has afforded
perspective. While WJHW’s work on
new buildings make headlines, Chris
sees renovation projects as being
the bigger challenge. While new
construction has its challenges,
renovations are often constrained
by existing conditions. What is
possible is limited by what is. Or as
one of Chris’s clients summed it up,
“You know I’m going from the stone
age to the space age.”

Leading WJHW requires that Chris
needs to drive innovation to keep
WJHW relevant to the industry and
their customers. What levers is he
pulling? On the design front, Chris
is evangelizing the use of modeling
tools – both visual and auditory.
Chris sees “an absolute explosion
of opportunities of advancement in
technology from computer-aided
design or building information
modeling”.

WJHW designed several standard
definition video production
facilities while they opened high
definition (“HD”) facilities for the
Atlanta Braves and the Toronto
Blue Jays. In 2020, Chris led the
implementation of the first pure
SMPTE 2110 video production
environment in a stadium or arena.
Each of these projects ushered in
new technology that had or will have
profound consequences for teams
and venue operators. Another
shift Chris witnessed firsthand
was the transition to massive and
complex video boards; first with
the largest video board at the time
– Jacksonville Jaguars at TIAA
Bank Field – then the “Halo Board”
in Atlanta, and now the “Oculus” at
SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles.

teams that are divisional rivals --
say, the Ravens and the Steelers
-- and they’re willing, very willing, to
share back-office type things and
technology things that don’t impact
their playing on the field.”

Chris sees “an

VIRTUALIZATION
  COMING OF AGE

Hyperconvergence isn’t a new technology.
Hyperconvergence is just the latest incarnation
of the shrinking data center.

\ \  BY BILL ANDERSON

Today, venue owners can leverage

hyperconvergence to reduce the
costs of the technology deployed in
their buildings.

Starting in the late 1990s, enterprise
customers seeking to address the rising
costs of server infrastructure began
seeking ways to load more applications
onto individual servers to reduce the
space, power, and cooling expenses related
to increasing demand for information
technology systems. Building on increasingly
powerful processors and time-sharing
concepts implemented on mainframes by
providers such as IBM, enterprise customers
began to employ virtualization to run multiple
workloads in parallel on a single server.
Pioneers in the space included VMWare and
Microsoft, two players who dominate the
virtualization space today. Virtualization
is the foundation of cloud computing and
has been enabling efficient scaling of IT
Operations for the last 20 years.

In parallel with the development of
virtualization, storage area networks (“SANs”)
emerged as a way for a collection of servers (a
“server farm”) to share disk space on a network

attached appliance. The benefit of shared
storage was the consolidation of unused space
across servers, reducing the total amount
of disk space required in the data center. As
virtualization technology matured, physical
storage devices were virtualized allowing
applications on one server to access storage
on one or more disconnected servers (“virtual
SANs” or “VSANs”).

The combination of virtualized applications
and virtualized storage together created the
possibility for any application to flexibly use
resources of any connected server; memory,
processor, and/or storage. In fact, with all
applications executing on top of a common
virtualization platform (the “hypervisor”) it
became possible to optimize performance
by eliminating the duplication of common
application components and dynamically
allocating the use of all connected
resources.

The resulting “hyperconverged systems”
where applications (“workloads” in
hyperconverged speak) run on commodity
servers provide a compact, energy efficient
platform for today’s enterprise compute
requirements.

which have compute and storage requirements of their
own, demanding more servers.

MANAGING INFRASTRUCTURE: THE IT
PROFESSIONAL’S DILEMMA

When Stadium Tech Report reached out to some
of our contacts in the venue space to discuss this
article, we heard the same message from many
venue IT professionals. Managing a hodge-podge of
servers collected over time was a burden. They faced

“When I take
over a building,
I spend the next
five years trying to
consolidate systems
onto a single
platform with a
comprehensive
support plan.”

a heterogenous mix of computers
dependent on disparate management
tools, tied to different security update
regimes, and covered by a patchwork
of support agreements. Keeping these
servers current and secure placed
significant demands on their time and
budgets.

While some IT managers were
resigned that this was just their
reality, a few had established plans
for consolidating their systems. One
operator with experience operating
multiple venues who preferred to
remain anonymous stated it plainly:

“When I take over a building, I spend the next five years
trying to consolidate systems onto a single platform
with a comprehensive support plan.” The business
case for consolidation was simple; consolidation would
decrease operating expense. However, the ability
to move forward quickly is constrained by capital
budgeting requiring that installed equipment reach full
depreciation before replacement was palatable.

If the business case for consolidating servers exists,
how did venues end up with a collection of disparate
platforms? In most cases, system procurement was

VENUE OPERATIONS: THE RISE OF TECHNOLOGY

Like data centers, public venues have evolved
dramatically over the past 20 years. Venue operations
have become increasingly dependent on technology
with main telecommunications rooms growing into
mini data centers connected to a network of smaller
telecommunications closets throughout a building.

Legacy systems which ran without any attached
communications infrastructure became connected.
Telephone systems which ran on large proprietary
PBXs were rendered onto
commodity servers. Facility
managers implemented applications
to manage their building systems
(building management systems
or “BMS”) developing centralized
control of systems including HVAC,
lighting, and electrical. Venue
security migrated from coaxial
connected cameras storing images
on tape to network connected
surveillance and access control
systems relying on servers with
large attached storage arrays.
Concessionaires migrated away
from proprietary point of sale (“POS”) terminals to PC
and tablet-based devices connected to server-based
concessions management software. Tickets migrated
from paper to digital. And venue sales organizations
implemented customer relationship management
(“CRM”) software to improve sales outcomes with some
CRM solutions layered on top of a data warehouse.

Today, every aspect of venue operation relies on
servers running in the building or on the cloud. These
systems are further dependent on large networks

INTERESTED IN
HYPERCONVERGED
INFRASTRUCTURE?
Below we’ve included links to the
manufacturer websites describing
three hyperconverged platforms
being used in venues today.

Cisco Hyperflex: https://www.
cisco.com/c/en/us/products/
hyperconverged-infrastructure/
index.html

Dell VxRails: https://www.

decentralized and the various
operating units within the venue
rarely or peripherally included the
IT organization in the procurement
process. The expectation was that
system vendors would determine
what servers were needed,
from what vendor they would be
sourced, and what type of support
agreement would be attached.
What followed vendor selection
was a request for rack space
and requirements for power and
connectivity.

THE PATH FORWARD:
OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES

For new venues, the business
case is clear. By establishing a
compute strategy early in the
design phase and enforcing
compliance with that strategy
across project scopes, the project
can achieve project savings and
lower Day 2 operating costs.
Stadium Tech report partner
AmpThink shared that in the last
18 months, they’ve incorporated
hyperconverged platforms from
Cisco, Dell, and Hewlett Packard
Enterprise in four of their projects
with platforms delivering between
22 and 95 virtual machines.
AmpThink Solution’s Architect
Robare Pruyn noted that “While
supporting our recent venue
projects, hyperconvergence
allowed us to quickly spin up and
support applications, meeting
project schedules without the

cost of additional hardware or
the complexity of integrating
new servers into the data center
and/or network.”  AmpThink’s
Adam Haskin shared that at So-Fi
Stadium, “the Hyperconverged
platform which currently supports
95 virtual machines replaced
dozens of physical servers with
all but the physical security
applications running on a platform
that lives in two data racks.”

For existing venues,
hyperconvergence offers the
opportunity to reduce the number
of servers under management
and the resulting operational
costs. Physical consolidation
reduces space requirements,
energy consumption,
simplifies securing your server
infrastructure, and reduces the
number of support contracts.
But achieving convergence
may require time. Establishing
a platform and organizational
standards for systems requiring
compute resources is the
foundation of future efforts.
Building the business case for
hyperconvergence will require a
detailed analysis of your current
operating environment and
planned system purchases across
business disciplines.

Looking to understand what a typical hyperconverged implementations looks like? Below, we’ve shared
the planning template that Stadium Tech Report partner AmpThink uses as the baseline for developing a
hyperconverged solution for an arena. The presented sizing is based on previous hyperconvergence projects and
provided here for illustration purposes only. Prior to proceeding with your own convergence project requirements
should be reviewed with a person/consultant familiar with virtualization and a technical representative of each
of the systems proposed for convergence. Not all applications are candidates for convergence and some system
providers limit support for systems operating in a converged/virtualized environment.
