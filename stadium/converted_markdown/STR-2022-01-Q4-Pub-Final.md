VENUES NEED
TO RADICALLY
RETHINK ENTRY
PROCEDURES

it’s apparent that while technology can assist venues in

After a year of welcoming full-capacity crowds back to stadiums,

eliminating fan pain points, it’s also clear that sudden shifts to

For this column, we’re going to focus on the process of stadium entry,

new ways of doing things don’t always go as smoothly as planned.

where we saw some of the biggest gains and also some of the biggest

problems in the first full year back from pandemic shutdowns. Most of

those revolved around the full-scale shift to all-digital ticketing, which

went smoothly in some places and not so smoothly in others.

While every venue is different in
its makeup and customs, we have
three basic ideas that should help
most venues in making their entry
procedures a better thing for
everybody. In no particular order of
importance, the suggestions include:
Expanding the physical security
perimeter, to improve walk-in flow;
adding more technology and process
design to keep bottlenecks from
occurring; and stepping up fan
education and adding incentives for
fans to arrive early to trim the last-
minute crowding as much as possible.

EXPANDING THE PERIMETER A
BASIC FIRST STEP

Some of these ideas are not new
-- extending the security perimeter
beyond the stadium walls, for
example, has been a staple of
Super Bowl preparations for years
now. Some newer stadiums, like
SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles and
Lower.com Field in Columbus, Ohio,
have built in the idea of distanced
perimeters into their venue design.

The Denver Broncos were one of
the more recent additions to the
extended-perimeter club, taking

advantage of a natural barrier of
sorts that exists in most areas
around Empower Field at Mile
High, where the actual stadium
entry gates sit a bit higher than
the surrounding parking lots and
walkways. With a little bit of extra
fencing the Broncos were able to
create a first line of security where
they set up wide entryways each
with multiple new walk-through
weapons detectors from CEIA USA.
After fans pass through security,
they enter plaza-type areas where
they can use stadium Wi-Fi to
download tickets if they haven’t
done that already, without having
to do so while in a line and possibly
holding up the process.

After that, fans can then enter via a
number of ticketing gates at each
entry, where staffers use handheld
scanners to verify tickets. From
what we saw at a recent Broncos
game, the process produces
very few lines, with the spaces in
between helping fans comfortably
through at their own pace.

According to Russ Trainor, VP of IT
for the Broncos, the new extended
perimeter system has cut entry
times down to an average of 2 to 3
minutes, far faster than previous
procedures that often involved
long lines backing up right at the
doors to the stadium. And while
the extra distancing is a smart first
step, it also is apparent that better
technology is also a necessary
component for a future-thinking
entry system.

ELIMINATING HUMAN CONTACT,
SPEEDING UP THE INTERACTIONS

Ever since the industry started
moving away from punching
paper tickets, there have been
many efforts to digitize the ticket-
verification process, some more
successful than others.

While many stadiums seem to have
settled on hand-held scanners for
ticket verification, those systems can
still have daylight or operator issues
that cause delays; fotunately a new era
of self-scanning pedestals is emerging,
with devices from Axess starting to win
wide acceptance among stadium IT
teams. Unlike some previous platforms
that tried to insert their own software in
between fans and ticketing operations,
the Axess devices connect directly to
ticketing platforms, eliminating fan
confusion and streamlining operator
functionality.

Just this year, we’ve seen Axess
pedestals at multiple venues,
including Lower.com Field, Climate
Pledge Arena, and at Empower
Field at Mile High, where they are
being tested at the entry to club
and premium seating areas. Like
some other entry systems there are
versions of the Axess pedestal that
can operate on battery power and
via Wi-Fi, making them extremely
flexible for changing security needs.

The other big step forward in entry
technologies is in weapons detection,
where walk-through systems are
quickly gaining favor for their obvious
improvements over the old airport-
style single-person gates where fans

have to take metal items out of their
pockets. We’ve seen systems from
vendors inlcuding Evolv, Patriot One
and CEIA are already in use at multiple
venues, from the aforementioned
stadiums as well as Wrigley Field in
Chicago.

game, in part by Ohio State putting
out informative short videos
that illustrated the process and
experience fans could expect, with an
emphasis on having fans download
tickets before arriving at the gate, a
problem many venues are still facing.

MORE FAN EDUCATION AND
INCENTIVES NEEDED

What’s instructive about watching
fans encounter the new weapons
detection systems is how hard it is
to shed old behaviors. At Lower.com
Field as well as at Empower Field
at Mile High multiple fans seemed
confused by the ease of the process,
with many stopping mid-gate to
raise their hands or take things out of
their pockets. While most fans learn
quickly to simply keep walking, the
reality is that even the simplest of
new procedures could benefit from
more fan education, something it
seems venues don’t do enough of.

Ohio State learned that lesson the
hard way at the start of this season,
when it encountered a perfect
storm of sorts. At the first game
when 102,000-seat Ohio Stadium
tried all-digital ticketing -- a sellout
matchup with Oregon -- a software
bug in the stadium’s Aruba Wi-Fi
network caused some partial Wi-Fi
outages, leading to huge backups as
late-arriving fans tried to download
their tickets all at the same time,
right outside the stadium walls.

The ensuing snafu -- which included
some fans trying to push their
way past security and ticketing
-- was corrected before the next

In this era of pervasive social media
consumption, it seems like it would
be easy for teams and venues to
provide more information for fans
about entry procedures, but we’ve
seen too few examples of such
messaging.

What might also help is some more venue
incentive for fans to arrive early and get
inside, to help eliminate the last-minute
crush of fans who have traditionally
tailgated until the last possible moment.
Some of that behavior is likely caused by
the high prices in many venues for food
and drink.

If you’re charging $15 for a non-
premium beer and $20+ for a mixed-
drink cocktail, you’re basically telling
your fans to stay outside the stadium
as long as possible. We’re surprised
that more venues aren’t following the
example set by the Atlanta Falcons and
Mercedes-Benz Stadium, where ultra-
low prices for concessions staples have
actually led to higher per-cap numbers.

Combined, all these ideas can help to
produce a new style of stadium entry
that is more in tune with the times,
which still require social distancing
and less human-to-human contact as
much as possible. If venues want to
keep attracting fans and keep them
safe, they should start by making it as
easy to get in as possible.

CLIMATE PLEDGE ARENA
CLIMATE PLEDGE ARENA

Beyond its curious name and the laudable aspirational goals
behind it, Seattle’s Climate Pledge Arena is also a venue filled with
leading-edge technology and forward-thinking procedures all
designed to enhance the fan experience.

\ \  BY PAUL KAPUSTKA

New entry technologies including

walk-through weapons
detectors, and innovative

“just walk out” concession stands using
Amazon technology are just some of the
deployments Climate Plege Arena will be
using to help eliminate traditional stadium
pain points. More traditional technologies
like acoustic baffles and pervasive
wireless networks are also part of an
experience that is already winning raves
from hockey fans as well as concertgoers
as the venue hit the ground running with
an ambitious 2021 schedule of events
following its mid-October opening.

While it retained the location and roof
of the old KeyArena, the $1.165 billion
privately financed renovation has
produced an entirely new venue inside,
one dug deeper down farther into the
Seattle earth to fit 17,100 seats for hockey
and closer to 18,000 for basketball.
And while its anchor tenant is the NHL’s
newest team, the Seattle Kraken, the
venue was built to be as busy as possible,
with basketball (the WNBA’s Seattle
Storm and Seattle University) as well as
multiple concerts already on its operating
schedule.

Speaking at an October sports-events conference
that coincided with the venue’s opening, Tim Leiweke,
CEO of the Oak View Group, the arena’s lead owner,
was clearly happy about a venue that has become a
labor of love during its refurbishing process. And while
Leiweke and the venue operations team are clearly
solidly behind the sustainability goals, the arena is also
clearly designed to be much more than just an example
of good intentions -- with its high-end finishes and
fan-friendly innovations, it is also aiming to be one of
the top public event spaces anywhere, and one that has
taken Covid complications into consideration as well.

Climate Pledge Arena’s opening “is an indication that
our industry is alive and still entrepreneurial,” Leiweke
said. “The question is, how do we get back to where we
were -- and better?”

WALKING THE SUSTAINABILITY TALK

Easily the most curious thing about the new venue is
its name, which is taken from the effort co-founded
by Amazon a few years ago. Known formally as The
Climate Pledge, the movement -- which has to date
attracted 217 large corporate entities to sign the pledge
-- has a goal for the world to become carbon neutral
by 2040, 10 years ahead of what is called for in the
drafted-in-2015 Paris Agreement.

While most corporate sponsors who shell out big
bucks for stadium naming rights simply put the
company name in lights, for its reported $300 to $400
million naming deal (as reported by Sports Business
Journal) Amazon chose to put its pledge atop the old
KeyArena -- and in turn it helped push the venue to be a
showplace for sustainable practices.

One of the more expensive moves in the sustainable
direction was a mid-renovation replacement of all gas
systems (used for heating and cooking) with electric
systems. The arena also gets all its power from
renewable sources, including some solar panels on
the side roof areas of the venue and its parking lots,
and also through contracts with Amazon solar farms.
The arena will also use some of Seattle’s historically
abundant rainfall to make the ice that the Kraken will
play on.

By keeping the roof (and not having to dispose of all its
mass) and the old KeyArena location, Climate Pledge
Arena is more sustainable just by geography since
it is well served by public transportation, including
Seattle’s iconic monorail line, which has an endpoint
at the Seattle Center. All fans with tickets to Kraken
games will get free public transit on the day of their
event, including on the monorail and Seattle’s light rail
system.

Inside the building, most fans will become aware of
sustainability efforts on the concessions side, with
compostible utensils and recycling efforts designed to
make the building as waste-free as possible. The arena
is also attempting to source at least 75 percent of all
ingredients from within a 300-mile radius, and has said
that non-meat alternatives and fresh produce will be
emphasized in the concession offerings.

Other processes, like eventually eliminating the use of
single-serving plastic containers, and allowing fans to bring
in their own water bottles that can be filled at fountains in the
arena, are things that are starting to appear in many places
in everyday life and in part in other arenas -- but it’s likely
that Climate Pledge Arena will be the venue-space leader in
overall sustainability commitment, something that Leiweke
said is worth the effort.

“I don’t think we’re going to change the world, but
we can inspire others,” he said at the arena-opening
conference.

GETTING IN QUICKLY

As a venue whose final construction phases took place
entirely during the Covid pandemic, it’s perhaps no
surprise that a good deal of the fan-facing technology
is aimed at making fans feel safer by eliminating lines
as much as possible. That process starts at the arena
entry, where Climate Pledge Arena is using ticketing

12    STADIUM TECH REPORT   I   WINTER 2022

pedestals from Axess, which support multiple methods
of fast, self-scanning technologies like NFC, QR codes
or bar codes. Climate Pledge Arena has also partnered
with Clear and its Clear Health Pass, which fans can
use to quickly show proof of Covid-19 vaccination, a
requirement for Seattle-area venues.

For security checks, Climate Pledge Arena is rolling
out walk-through weapons detectors from Patriot
One, which allow fans to be scanned without having to
remove things like keys and phones from their pockets.
While there’s not enough data yet to know exactly how
much faster the walk-through security systems are
compared to older metal detectors, you don’t need
numbers to see how quickly fans get through when you
see the new systems being used.

“In our opinion, the walk-through [security systems]
are far superior, and the upside is huge,” said Michael
Downing, chief security officer for the Oak View Group.

GRAB AND GO TO ELIMINATE CONCESSIONS LINES

While many venues are busy testing different kinds
of ways to speed up concessions operations, Climate
Plege Arena seems to be going farther and faster than
most to make sure fans get food and drink as quickly as
possible.

The most visible and notable moves in this direction
are the four in-arena stands that are using the Amazon
Just Walk Out technology. Like other competing
technologies, the Amazon-powered stands use a
prepayment scheme involving either a credit card
swiped at the entry or through an application signup;
for Amazon that means using Amazon’s Amazon One
system, where registered users need only swipe their
palm before entering. Once the gate opens to let you
in, you simply take whatever food or drink items you
want, and then leave through the gated exit without
stopping. The systems use a combination of cameras

and sensors to determine items chosen, and then bill
customers after they leave.

Dave Curry, vice president of technology for Climate
Pledge Arena, said that the arena is “thrilled” with the
Amazon-powered stores, which he said have proven
extremely popular with fans during the arena’s opening
months of events.

“We’re really happy that it worked out the way we
intended it to,” Curry said. “It’s just great to see people
not standing in lines.”

Curry, who took us on a technology tour of the arena
the day before it opened, also said fans are catching
on quickly to the “other” main concessions-speeding
technology, which is part machine and part process.
The machine involved is a new Toshiba checkout
terminal with a large optical scanner; the process part
is a large number of “grab and go” concession stands,
where fans simply pick up boxed items and canned
drinks, and then scan them at the Toshiba terminals.

While other stadiums are trying similar methods,
Climate Pledge Arena has made an obvious large
commitment to the idea, with one popular local Asian
food stand having more than 20 checkout terminals
available -- again, so fans don’t have to wait in lines.

Climate Pledge Arena
is innovating by using

“We’re doing everything we can to make it work as fast
as possible,” said Curry, pointing out that the food-
item boxes all have large, clearly legible bar
codes that make scanning easier. Unlike some
grab-and-go stands at other venues, which
have limited items, stands at Climate Pledge
Arena offer a full range of hot and cold choices,
including chicken sandwiches and pizza.

digital display screens, which should prove helpful for
wayfinding and pre- and post-event information.

The arena’s overall concessions technology got a
big vote of approval from fans at the first public
event, highlighted by a story in the local tech
publication GeekWire that quoted a fan who was
amazed by his ability “to get a beer in 8 seconds”
at one of the Amazon walk-out stands.

DIGITAL DISPLAYS HELP LIGHTEN UP THE
‘BASEMENT’ FEELING

By digging down, there’s no denying that you
do get a little bit of a feeling of descending into
somebody’s basement when you go to the premium
seating areas at Climate Pledge Arena. But thanks to a
large number of Daktronics digital displays, including
one that wraps around several walls with irregular
edges, the arena makes things below-ground feel more
alive, especially when the wraparound display shows
underwater scenes, complete with sharks and scuba
divers swimming through.

As a top end design, you would expect the connectivity
to be first rate at Climate Pledge Arena, and it is. With
both the shared cellular networks and Wi-Fi network
deployed by Verizon, the Wi-Fi uses Cisco gear and
under-seat deployments in the bowl. The venue also
recently added some new Cisco Catalyst 9104 Wi-Fi
antennas, which have a much greater reach capability,
for floor seating coverage at concerts.

According to Curry the venue’s cellular DAS already
has participation from all major wireless carriers, and
also has 5G services available from Verizon. There is
also solid Wi-Fi coverage in the plaza area surrounding
the arena, with APs mounted on light poles and out-
building rooftops.

DOING GOOD WHILE DOING WELL

Even if some of the Seattle locals we know are
ambivalent about the arena’s name and purported
goals, it’s hard to find anyone who thinks that any
business that is trying to be more sustainable is a bad
thing. Area hockey fans are simply ecstatic just to
have a great place to cheer on a local NHL team, and
Seattle’s NBA fans -- who still feel scorned by the loss
of the Sonics -- are hoping that having a first-class
arena open and in place can help bring the Sonics back
some day.

Big musical acts already seem to be voting in favor of
Climate Pledge Arena with their presence, with names
like the Eagles, Coldplay and the Foo Fighters already
having performed at the venue, and many others
scheduled to appear soon.

And if along the way Climate Pledge Arena can change
a few minds about the need to make conscious
decisions about how whatever we do affects the
planet, that’s a good thing. Especially when you can add
that positive feeling to all the other benefits supported
by a first-class arena experience.

\ \  BY PAUL KAPUSTKA

As one of the latest teams to join a growing trend, the Denver

Broncos recently added walk-through weapons detectors to their
entry systems at Empower Field at Mile High, greatly speeding up
fan entry times, according to stadium IT executives.

By combining walk-through weapons detectors from CEIA USA with a
deployment strategy that pushed the initial security perimeter farther
away from the stadium gates, the Broncos have been able to speed up
NFL home-game entry times to “about two or three minutes” on average,
according to Russ Trainor, senior vice president of information technology
for the Broncos.

Stadium Tech Report was on hand at a recent Broncos
home game to view the new entry strategy, a tactic being
deployed at many venues to try to eliminate lines as
much as possible. With all stadiums moving to all-digital
ticketing en masse after reopening to fans this year,
many stadiums and arenas have had entry-procedure
challenges mainly due to fans trying to figure out how
and when to download tickets. At some venues this past
year, large lines have formed when fans attempted to
download tickets just before reaching ticketing gates,
leading to confusion and frustration.

TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SOME BUILT-IN SPACE

At Empower Field at Mile High, the Broncos were able
to take advantage of a natural barrier of sorts, the
fact that the stadium proper sits on a small hill that
rises slightly above most of the surrounding parking-
lot areas. By deploying some temporary fencing the
Broncos flipped their prior procedure to put security
checks first, allowing fans to be inside a secure space
before formally entering the stadium by going through
individual gates to have their tickets hand-scanned by
stadium staff. At entry gates all around the stadium,
Stadium Tech Report didn’t see any big line backups at
either the security or ticketing gates.

According to Trainor the Broncos have been rolling out
the new security system throughout the fall, and while
there wasn’t anything visible in terms of signage or
messaging to explain the new technology, most fans
quickly caught on that all they needed to do was walk
through the post-like gates of the CEIA “Opengate”
systems without having to stop or take items out of
their pockets or bags. Still, many other fans were

clearly unfamiliar with the systems, as Stadium Tech
Report saw multiple instances of fans stopping, taking
things out of their pockets, or holding their hands up in
the air, behaviors possibly learned from other weapons
detection systems like those found at airports.

If you are looking for insights on stadium connectivity,
there’s no better way to learn than from your peers.
Results from our 2021 Stadium Connectivity Outlook survey are now
available for free download -- read them today!

The calendar year of 2021 was especially interesting for the large public venue business, especially
since nobody knew how venue technology teams would cope with both the Covid-related
shutdowns and then the return of fans to stadiums and arenas. In our mind, those conditions made
it the perfect time to ask the industry participants themselves to assess where they have been and
where they are going from a stadium connectivity point of view.

In a partnership with sponsor Verizon, in July and August of this year we reached out to the Stadium
Tech Report audience and asked them to participate in our inaugural Stadium Connectivity
Outlook survey, which asked a wide range of questions about the current state of a venue’s
connectivity, and where the venues, teams and schools would prioritize investments and strategies
as the sporting world moved back to full arenas in a world that had radically changed almost
overnight. Their answers are now available for you to read, in both a survey results format and an
accompanying white paper that summarizes the data.

These are not just our words but the insights of our audience - more than 100 respondents spent
their time providing answers - honest feedback that we hope will provide an industry-wide
perspective on the common issues facing venues of all shapes and sizes, from large NFL and
college football stadiums to small concert halls. What emerged was a snapshot of where we’re
at as an industry, and where we’re going as we build on solid basic connectivity as a core and use
that to move forward in an uncertain direction but one still with concrete goals: A better, safer fan
experience with more control on operations and the bottom line.

FOOTBALL RETURNS TO

WRIGLEY FIELD

\ \  BY PAUL KAPUSTKA

Football at Wrigley Field? Those of us old

enough can remember the Chicago Bears
playing next to the winter-dead ivy, with
Gale Sayers romping for touchdowns next

to the outfield bleachers. And in 2010, a college game
between Northwestern and Illinois took place, but the
teams could only rush toward one end zone because
the full field didn’t quite fit.

But now thanks to some recent stadium renovations
that included making the Cubs’ dugout and some third-
base seats moveable, football can fit comfortably
again in the Friendly Confines.

Stadium Tech Report field scout Lisa Farrell was on hand
in November with some family and friends, watching the
Northwestern Wildcats take on the Purdue Boilermakers
in a Big Ten matchup at Wrigley Field. Here are some
notes from Farrell’s visit to the game, which she said
used concessions operations from the Cubs instead of
trying to bring in a temporary operation. Ticketing was
through the MLB Ballpark app.

CONNECTED

FAN

EXPERIENCE

For entry, Farrell said the Cubs’ use of the new Evolv
weapons detection systems made getting into the
park a much faster process than previous Cubs games.

“A few years ago when [the Cubs] started the digital
ticket process, access to the internet either through
Wi-Fi or cell service was pretty awful and held up the
entry process,” Farrell said. “But they have improved
connectivity [near the gates] and now entering the
park is a breeze. Works very well since they no longer
require fans to empty their pockets of keys and phone.
Just walk right through.”

According to Farrell the stadium still has walk-around
concessions vendors, but they now use handheld
credit-card readers to bypass having to handle cash.
And while the stadium (like many others) bills itself
as “cash-free,” Farrell said “when my son went for a
hot chocolate, they very gladly took his cash at the
concession stand. No surprise there!”

Wrigley’s iconic manual scoreboard, Farrell said,
didn’t have any problems adjusting to football. “The
scoreboard was pretty interesting. They had the other
Big Ten games on the board and updated scores. Like
baseball, you had to do the math across the quarters to
get the score. That got a little challenging with the Ohio
State game.”

Though Northwestern lost the game to Purdue, and
there were some complaints from players about field
conditions, overall Farrell said it was a great time for
fans. And Farrell also said the stadium entertainment
crew didn’t forget where they were. “At the end of the
third quarter, we had the third quarter stretch,” Farrell
said “The organist was there and played Take Me Out to
the Ballgame.”
